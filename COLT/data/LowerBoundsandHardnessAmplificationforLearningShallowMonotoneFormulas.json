{"1": "Much work has been done on learning various classes of \u201csimple\"monotone functions under the uniform distribution.In this paper we give the first unconditional lower bounds for learningproblems of this sort by showing that polynomial-time algorithms cannotlearn shallow monotone Boolean formulas under the uniform distributionin the well-studied Statistical Query (SQ) model.We introduce a new approach to understanding the learnability of \u201csimple\u201d monotone functions that is based ona recent characterization of Strong SQ learnability by \\citetSimon-2007Using the characterization we first show that depth-3 monotone formulas of size n^o(1) cannot be learned byany polynomial-time SQ algorithm to accuracy 1 -1/(\\log n)^\u03a9(1).  We then build on this result to show thatdepth-4 monotone formulas of size n^o(1) cannot be learned evento a certain \\frac 1 2 + o(1) accuracy in polynomial time.  Thisimproved hardness is achieved using a general technique that weintroduce for amplifying the hardness of \u201cmildly hard\u201d learningproblems in either the PAC or SQ framework.
