Choose the following hierarchical preference relation. With first priority choose a union of as few as possible boxes. With second priority, prefer a concept R (= union of boxes) over all concepts R(cid:48) that are proper subsets of R. Fig. 3 shows how the teaching set for each single box of the target concept should be chosen. If the student gets (up to) k teaching sets of this kind, she will put the largest possible box around each positive example. The negative examples at the border of the box ensure that these boxes do not become too large.  10. Conclusions  Preference-based teaching uses the natural notion of preference relation to extend the classical teaching model. The resulting model is (i) more powerful than the classical one, (ii) resolves dif- ficulties with the recursive teaching model in the case of infinite concept classes, and (iii) is at the same time free of coding tricks even according to the definition by Goldman and Mathias (1996). Our examples of algebraic and geometric concept classes demonstrate that preference-based teach- ing can be achieved very efficiently with naturally defined teaching sets and based on intuitive preference relations such as inclusion. We believe that further studies of the PBTD will provide in- sights into structural properties of concept classes that render them easy or hard to learn in a variety of formal learning models.  We have shown that spanning sets lead to a general-purpose construction for preference-based teaching sets of only positive examples. While this result is fairly obvious, it provides further justification of the model of preference-based teaching, since the teaching sets it yields are often intuitively exactly those a teacher would choose in the classroom (for instance, one would repre- sent convex polygons by their vertices). It should be noted, too, that it can sometimes be difficult to establish whether the upper bound on PBTD obtained this way is tight, or whether the use of negative examples or preference relations other than inclusion yield smaller teaching sets. A further challenge is posed by the study of unions of geometric objects such as axis-aligned boxes. There seems to be no obvious way of combining preference-based teaching sets for a number of objects to a preference-based teaching set for their union, and it is unclear how to choose preference relations in the best possible way. Generally, the choice of preference relation provides a degree of freedom that increases the power of the teacher but also increases the difficulty of establishing lower bounds on the number of examples required for teaching.
