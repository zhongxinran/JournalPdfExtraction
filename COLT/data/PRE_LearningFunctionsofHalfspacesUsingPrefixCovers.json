Conclusions  Our algorithm for learning functions of halfspaces exploits the connection between halfspaces and ROBPs. It would be interesting if this connection could lead to improved algorithms for agnosti- cally learning halfspaces. In particular, the problem of agnostically learning poly(n)-ROBPs with membership queries is open. A (query) algorithm for this problem will give a (query) algorithm for agnostically learning halfspaces.  The best known algorithm for agnostically learning a halfspace under the uniform distribution on {0, 1}n due to Kalai et al. (2008) runs in time O(n1/\u03b52). Their paper also shows that a poly(n, 1/\u03b5) algorithm for agnostically learning halfspaces from random examples alone will result in a poly(n) time algorithm for the notorious noisy parity problem. This seems to suggest that such an algo- rithm is perhaps unlikely, but it leaves open the possibility of a poly(n, 1/\u03b5) algorithm that uses membership queries. ROBP-based algorithms seem to be the only tool we currently have to exploit membership queries in the context of halfspace learning.
