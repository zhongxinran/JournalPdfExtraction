{"1": "We present a simple query-algorithm for learning arbitrary functions of k halfspaces under any product distribution on the Boolean hypercube. Our algorithms learn any function of k halfspaces to within accuracy \u03b5 in time \\emphO((nk/\u03b5)^k+1) under any product distribution on 0, 1^\\emphn using read-once branching programs as a hypothesis. This gives the first \\emphpoly(n, 1/\u03b5) algorithm for learning even the intersection of 2 halfspaces under the uniform distribution on 0, 1^\\emphn previously known algorithms had an exponential dependence either on the accuracy parameter \u03b5 or the dimension \\emphn. To prove this result, we identify a new structural property of Boolean functions that yields learnability with queries: that of having a small prefix cover."}
