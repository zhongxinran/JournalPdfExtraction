{"1": "Mixability of a loss governs the best possible performance when\taggregating expert predictions with respect to that loss. The\tdetermination of the mixability constant for binary losses is\tstraightforward but opaque. In the binary case we make this \ttransparent and simpler by\tcharacterising mixability in terms of the second derivative of the\tBayes risk of proper losses.  We then extend this result to\tmulticlass proper losses where there are few existing results.  We\tshow that mixability is governed by the Hessian of the Bayes risk,\trelative to the Hessian of the Bayes risk for log loss. We\tconclude by comparing our result to other work that bounds\tprediction performance in terms of the geometry of the Bayes risk.\tAlthough all calculations are for proper losses, we also show how\tto carry the results across to improper losses."}
