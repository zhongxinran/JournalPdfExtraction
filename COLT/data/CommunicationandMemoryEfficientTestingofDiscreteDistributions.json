{"1": "We study distribution testing with communication and memory constraints  in the following computational models: (1) The {\\em one-pass streaming model}  where the goal is to minimize the sample complexity of the protocol subject to a memory constraint, and (2) A {\\em distributed model} where the data samples reside at multiple machines and the goal is to minimize the communication cost of the protocol. In both these models, we provide efficient algorithms for uniformity/identity testing (goodness of fit) and closeness testing (two sample testing). Moreover, we show nearly-tight lower bounds on (1) the sample complexity of any one-pass streaming tester for uniformity, subject to the memory constraint,  and (2) the communication cost of any uniformity testing protocol,  in a restricted \u201cone-pass\u201d model of communication."}
