{"1": "We consider the problem of efficiently exploring the arms of a stochastic bandit to identify the best subset. Under the PAC and the fixed-budget formulations, we derive improved bounds by using KL-divergence-based confidence intervals. Whereas the application of a similar idea in the regret setting has yielded bounds in terms of the KL-divergence between the arms, our bounds in the pure-exploration setting involve the Chernoff information between the arms. In addition to introducing this novel quantity to the bandits literature, we contribute a comparison between the \u201cracing\u201d and \u201csmart sampling\u201d strategies for pure-exploration problems, finding strong evidence in favor of the latter."}
