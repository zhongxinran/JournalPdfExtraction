{"1": "In the present work,  we give a solution to the following  question from manifold learning.  Suppose data belonging to a high dimensional Euclidean space is drawn independently, identically distributed  from a measure supported on a low dimensional twice  differentiable embedded manifold $M$, and corrupted by a small amount of  gaussian noise. How can we produce a manifold $M\u2019$ whose Hausdorff distance to $M$ is small and whose reach is not much smaller than the reach of $M$?"}
