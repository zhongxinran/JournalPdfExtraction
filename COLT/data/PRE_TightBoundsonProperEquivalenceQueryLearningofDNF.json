In this case, since h(a) agrees with the majority of the values f1(a), . . . , fN (a),  such a counterexample causes the size of CON to be multiplied by at most 1/2.  Case 2: a /\u2208 Z.

Membership queries provably help for learning log n-term DNF  The following is a sharpening of the arguments from Section 6 to apply to log(n)-term DNF.  Theorem 11 Let A be any algorithm which learns the class of all log n-term DNF formulas using only equivalence queries which are DNF formulas with at most nlog n terms. Then A must make at least n(log n)/3 equivalence queries in the worst case.  Sketch of Proof of Theorem 11: As in the proof of Theorem 6 we consider M (n, t, s), the class of all monotone DNF over n variables with exactly t distinct terms each of length exactly s. For this proof we fix s and t both to be log n. We will show that given any DNF formula with at most nlog n terms, there is an assignment such that at most a 1/n(log n)/3 fraction of the DNFs in M (n, t, s) agree with f on that assignment; this implies the theorem by the arguments of Theorem 6.
