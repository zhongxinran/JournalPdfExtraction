{"1": "We show that it is possible to obtain an $O(\\epsilon^{-4/3})$ runtime \u2014 including computational cost \u2014 for finding $\\epsilon$-stationary points of nonconvex functions using cutting plane methods. This improves on the best known epsilon dependence achieved by cubic regularized Newton of $O(\\epsilon^{-3/2})$ as proved by Nesterov and Polyak (2006). Our techniques utilize the convex until proven guilty principle proposed by Carmon, Duchi, Hinder, and Sidford (2017)."}
