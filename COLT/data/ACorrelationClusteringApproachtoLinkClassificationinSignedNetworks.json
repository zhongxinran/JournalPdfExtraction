{"1": "Motivated by social balance theory, we develop a theory of link classification in signed networks using the correlation clustering index as measure of label regularity. We derive learning bounds in terms of correlation clustering within three fundamental transductive learning settings: online, batch and active. Our main algorithmic contribution is in the active setting, where we introduce a new family of efficient link classifiers based on covering the input graph with small circuits. These are the first active algorithms for link classification with mistake bounds that hold for arbitrary signed networks."}
