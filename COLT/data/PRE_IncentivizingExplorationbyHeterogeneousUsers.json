Conclusion  We study the problem of incentivizing exploration with heterogeneous user preferences. We pro- posed an algorithm that achieves expected cumulative regret O(N e2/p+N log3(T )), using expected cumulative payments of O(N 2e2/p). It is possible to improve these bounds to polynomial (in N and 1/p) when p is known or the preference distribution is discrete. In fact, we conjecture that this should be possible even in the full generality of our model. As a first step towards such a polynomial bound, we can obtain an exponential dependence on 1/(pN ) by changing the probability threshold 6, which gives polynomial dependence unless some arm has a much smaller fraction to be of the population preferring it.  1 N log(s)  Taking this goal one step further, we would like to develop algorithms that do not require all arms to be preferred by a strictly positive fraction of agents. An alternate algorithm might only incentivize an arm if its estimated attribute vector is close enough to a Pareto frontier. The regret will then be \u2126(log(T )) when at least one arm falls below the Pareto frontier, as we no longer have free exploration of all arms. It is likely that a bound will deteriorate as the number of such unpreferred arms increases.  Finally, it would be desirable to generalize to utility functions beyond inner products. We believe that similar results hold for arbitrary Lipschitz-continuous utility functions of the arm\u2019s attribute vector, and that only minor modifications are necessary to the algorithm and proofs.
