Thanks also to Yoonkyung Lee for inviting me to give a talk at the ASA Conference on Statistical Learning and Data Mining held in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in June 2012; part of this work was done while preparing for that talk. This research was supported in part by a Ramanujan Fellowship from the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India.
