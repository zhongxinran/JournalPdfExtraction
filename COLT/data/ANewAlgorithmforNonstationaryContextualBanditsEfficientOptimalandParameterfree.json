{"1": "We propose the first contextual bandit algorithm that is parameter-free, efficient, and optimal in terms of dynamic regret. Specifically, our algorithm achieves $\\mathcal{O}(\\min\\{\\sqrt{KST}, K^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\Delta ^{\\frac{1}{3}}T^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\})$ dynamic regret for a contextual bandit problem with $T$ rounds, $K$ actions, $S$ switches and $\\Delta$ total variation in data distributions. Importantly, our algorithm is adaptive and does not need to know $S$ or $\\Delta$ ahead of time, and can be implemented efficiently assuming access to an ERM oracle. Our results strictly improve the $\\mathcal{O} (\\min \\{S^{\\frac{1}{4}}T^{\\frac{3}{4}}, \\Delta^{\\frac{1}{5}}T^{\\frac{4}{5}}\\})$ bound of (Luo et al., 2018), and greatly generalize and improve the $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{ST})$ result of (Auer et al., 2018) that holds only for the two-armed bandit problem without contextual information. The key novelty of our algorithm is to introduce {\\it replay phases}, in which the algorithm acts according to its previous decisions for a certain amount of time in order to detect non-stationarity while maintaining a good balance between exploration and exploitation."}
