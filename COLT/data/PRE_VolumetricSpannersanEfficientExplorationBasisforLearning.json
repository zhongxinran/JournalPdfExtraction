Here, we could use Lemma 10 in order to approximately sample from the required distribution.  A naive analysis results in a running time polynomial in both d and T for each such step, com- pleting the proof of the existence of a solution with polynomial running time. A more refined analysis for exactly such processes can be found in (Dick et al., 2014). Their analysis of the con- tinuous exponential weights algorithm (i.e., the geometric hedge algorithm) in their section 3.2 and 3.3, gives rise to a sampling technique that approximates the required log-concave distribution in a manner that incurs an additional O( T ) regret, at the running time cost of poly(d, log(T )) per sample. As the purpose of this paper is to provide an algorithm of polynomial running time, we defer the complete analysis of the running time to the full version of the paper.  \u221a  Discussion: Notice that to obtain a (p, \u03b5)-exp-volumetric spanner for a log-concave distribution p over a body K we simply choose sufficiently many i.i.d samples from p. Since in the above algorithm pt is always log-concave, it follows that S(cid:48) t consists of i.i.d samples from pt, meaning that if we would not have required S(cid:48)(cid:48) t , the exploration and exploration strategies would be the same! Since we still require the set S(cid:48)(cid:48) t , there exists a need for a separate exploration strategy. \u221a Interestingly, the 2 d-ratio-volumetric spanner is obtained by taking a barycentric spanner, which is the exploration strategy of Dani et al. (2007).  The authors would like to thank Carmel Domshlak for helpful discussions in earlier stages of this work.
