{"1": "We present new minimax results that concisely capture the relative benefits of source and target labeled data, under {covariate-shift}. Namely, we show that, in general classification settings, the benefits of target labels are controlled by a \\emph{transfer-exponent} $\\gamma$ that encodes how \\emph{singular} $Q$ is locally w.r.t. $P$, and interestingly allows situations where transfer did not seem possible under previous insights. In fact, our new minimax analysis \u2013 in terms of $\\gamma$ \u2013 reveals a \\emph{continuum of regimes} ranging from situations where target labels have little benefit, to regimes where target labels dramatically improve classification.  We then show that a recently proposed semi-supervised procedure can be extended to adapt to unknown $\\gamma$, and therefore requests target labels only when beneficial, while achieving nearly minimax transfer rates."}
