{"1": "There has been considerable recent interest in distribution-tests whose run-time and sample requirements are sublinear in the domain-size k. We study two of the most important tests under the conditional-sampling model where each query specifies a subset S of the domain, and the response is a sample drawn from S according to the underlying distribution. For identity testing, which asks whether the underlying distribution equals a specific given distribution or \u03b5-differs from it, we reduce the known time and sample complexities from \\widetilde\\mathcalO(\u03b5^-4) to \\widetilde\\mathcalO(\u03b5^-2), thereby matching the information theoretic lower bound. For closeness testing, which asks whether two distributions underlying observed data sets are equal or different, we reduce existing complexity from \\widetilde\\mathcalO(\u03b5^-4 \\log^5 k) to an even sub-logarithmic \\widetilde\\mathcalO(\u03b5^-5 \\log \\log k) thus providing a better bound to an open problem in Bertinoro Workshop on Sublinear Algorithms (Fisher, 2014)."}
