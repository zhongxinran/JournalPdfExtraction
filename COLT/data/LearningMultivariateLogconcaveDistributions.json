{"1": "We study the problem of estimating multivariate log-concave probability density functions. We prove the first sample complexity upper bound for learning log-concave densities on $\\mathbb{R}^d$, for all $d \u22651$. Prior to our work, no upper bound on the sample complexity of this learning problem was known for the case of $d>3$. In more detail, we give an estimator that, for any $d \\ge 1$ and $\u03b5>0$, draws $\\tilde{O}_d \\left( (1/\u03b5)^(d+5)/2 \\right)$ samples from an unknown target log-concave density on $R^d$, and outputs a hypothesis that (with high probability) is $\u03b5$-close to the target, in total variation distance. Our upper bound on the sample complexity comes close to the known lower bound of $\\Omega_d \\left( (1/\u03b5)^(d+1)/2 \\right)$ for this problem."}
