Previous lower bounds on the covering numbers of convex functions in (Bronshtein, 1976, Proof of Theorem 6) and (Dryanov, 2009, Section 2) (for d = 1) are based on perturbations of a function whose graph is a subset of a sphere; a more complicated convex function than f0. The perturbations of f0 in the above proof can also be used to simplify the lower bound arguments in those papers.  Remark 7 For functions defined on [0, 1]d, the Lp metric, p > 1, is larger than L1. Thus, when a = 0, b = 1, the conclusion of Theorem 5 also holds for the Lp metric with p > 1. The scaling identity (2) then gives the following inequality for arbitrary a < b: There exist positive constants c and (cid:15)0, depending only on the dimension d, such that for every p \u2265 1, B > 0 and b > a, we have  (cid:16)  log M  C([a, b]d, B), (cid:15); Lp  \u2265 c  (cid:17)  (cid:18)  (cid:15) B(b \u2212 a)d/p  (cid:19)\u2212d/2  ,  for (cid:15) \u2264 (cid:15)0B(b \u2212 a)d/p.  4. Concluding remarks  In this paper we have studied the covering numbers of C([a, b]d, B), the class of all uniformly bounded convex functions, defined on the hypercube [a, b]d, under the L1 metric, 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e. Our main result shows that we can forgo the assumption of a uniform Lipschitz norm for the underlying class of convex functions (as was assumed in Bronshtein (1976)) and still show that the logarithm of the (cid:15)-covering number grows at the same order (cid:15)\u2212d/2, under the L1 metric. Specifically, we prove that the logarithm of the (cid:15)-covering number under the L1 metric is bounded from both above and below by a constant multiple of (cid:15)\u2212d/2. Our proof of the upper bound in Theorem 2 is based on Lemma 3 which bounds the L1 distance between two convex functions by a constant multiple of the Hausdorff distance between their epigraphs. Our proof of the lower bound in Theorem 5 is based on an explicit construction of a finite packing subset of the space of uniformly bounded convex functions. In the"}
