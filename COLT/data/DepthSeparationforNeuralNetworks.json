{"1": "Let $f:\\mathbb{S}^d-1\\times \\mathbb{S}^d-1\\to\\mathbb{S}$ be a function of the form $f(x,x\u2019) = g(\u27e8x,x\u2019\u27e9)$ for $g:[-1,1]\\to \\mathbb{R}$. We give a simple proof that shows that poly-size depth two neural networks with (exponentially) bounded weights cannot approximate $f$ whenever $g$ cannot be approximated by a low degree polynomial. Moreover, for many $g$\u2019s, such as $g(x)=\\sin(\\pi d^3x)$, the number of neurons must be $2^\u03a9\\left(d\\log(d)\\right)$. Furthermore, the result holds w.r.t. the uniform distribution on $\\mathbb{S}^d-1\\times \\mathbb{S}^d-1$. As many functions of the above form can be well approximated by poly-size depth three networks with poly-bounded weights, this establishes a separation between depth two and depth three networks w.r.t. the uniform distribution on $\\mathbb{S}^d-1\\times \\mathbb{S}^d-1$."}
