It would be surpris- ing if such a simple compression scheme would work for every concept class. Indeed, the compactness theorem of first order logic would imply the existence of a uniform formula defining a reconstruction function for all concept classes of given VC-dimension. One could however imagine such a uniform formula with, for example, quantifiers over the domain X. The computation would then involve queries on the whole underlying concept class (X, C). Its computational complexity would then depend on the concept class.  Our results apply to a wide family of concept classes, most notably, geometric concept classes and concept classes definable in the structure (cid:104)R; +, \u00b7, \u2264, exp, 0, 1(cid:105). One important family of concept classes for which we do not know if our theorem applies is the family of maximum concept classes, first studied by Floyd and Warmuth (1995). A concept class (X, C) is called maximum if for every finite set A, the number of concepts on A equals the upper bound attained by Sauer\u2019s lemma. As discussed earlier, such concept classes always have a VC-dim compression scheme (in fact an unlabeled compression scheme).  Rubinstein and Rubinstein (2012) suggest studying compression schemes via operating on geometric representations. They study classes that correspond to Hyperbolic arrange- ments and PL hyperplanes. It is natural to ask what kind of compression schemes arise from general representations in NIP structures. If any maximal concept class can be represented in an NIP structure, this would give a positive solution to the problem of sample compres- sion (without O(d) bound however). On the other hand, a maximal concept class with VC-dim(ALT (X; C)) = \u221e cannot be embedded in an NIP structure without an increase in the VC-dimension.  Finally we wish to discuss further directions toward a complete solution to the problem. Due to our extensive use of Ramsey\u2019s theorem, it would be challenging to use our methods to obtain VC-dim bounds on compression schemes. However the methods presented in this paper might be used for the construction of compression schemes in general, in particular definable compression schemes. Theorem 20 due to Matou\u02c7sek is part of a family of Helly type theorems. An analogue theorem exists, for example, for convex sets whose VC-dimension is unbounded (see, Alon and Kleitman (1992)). Thus, our requirements from ALT (X; C) may be relaxed or altered. Other concept classes derived from the original concept class might also be exploited. Finally, it would be interesting to know if there are necessary conditions to the existence of compression schemes that relate to NIP structures. This might enable the construction of a counter example to the compression conjecture.  Acknowledgments  References  Mathematical Logic, 2008.
