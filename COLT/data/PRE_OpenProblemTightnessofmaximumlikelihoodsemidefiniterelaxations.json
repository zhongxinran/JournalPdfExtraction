The left plot corresponds to the Procrustes problem (setting of Conjecture 1) when d = 3, n = 20, m = 30 and the right plot corresponds to the multi reference alignment problem treated in Bandeira et al. (2014). Both plots suggest that rank recovery happens with high probability, below certain noise levels.  The multireference alignment consists in estimating a d-dimensional signal by observing n shifted noisy copies of it. For the sake of brevity, we will not describe the problem or the SDP based relaxation here (and refer the reader to Bandeira et al. (2014)) but take the opportunity to con- jecture that a similar phenomenon happens: Below a certain noise level the solution to SDP-based relaxation in Bandeira et al. (2014) has rank d, thus matching the quasi-MLE. Although not going into details, we note that the SDP for this problem is considerably different than (3), in particular, it has \u2126 (cid:0)n2d2(cid:1) positivity constraints. Also, this problem is discrete and so exact recovery is possible. However, exact recovery can be shown to be only possible for asymptotically vanishing levels of noise and here we conjecture rank recovery happens for a constant level of noise.  References  E.
