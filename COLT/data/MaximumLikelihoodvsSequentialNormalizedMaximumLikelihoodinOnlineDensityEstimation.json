{"1": "The paper considers sequential prediction of individual sequences  with log loss (online density estimation) using an exponential  family of distributions. We first analyze the regret of the maximum  likelihood (\u201cfollow the leader\u201d) strategy. We find that this  strategy is (1) suboptimal and (2) requires an additional assumption  about boundedness of the data sequence. We then show that both  problems can be be addressed by adding the currently predicted  outcome to the calculation of the maximum likelihood, followed by  normalization of the distribution.  The strategy obtained in this  way is known in the literature as the \\emphsequential normalized    maximum likelihood or \\emphlast-step minimax strategy. We show  for the first time that for general exponential families, the regret  is bounded by the familiar (k/2) \\log n and thus optimal up to  O(1).  We also show the relationship to the Bayes strategy with  Jeffreys\u2019 prior."}
