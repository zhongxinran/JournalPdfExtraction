Discussion  In this we paper we classified all finite partial-monitoring games under stochastic envi- ronments, based on their minimax regret. We conjecture that our results extend to non- stochastic environments. This is the major open question that remains to be answered.  One question which we did not discuss so far is the computational e\ufb03ciency of our algorithm. The issue is twofold. The first computational question is how to e\ufb03ciently decide which of the four classes a given game (L, H) belongs to. The second question is the computational e\ufb03ciency of Balaton for a fixed easy game. Fortunately, in both cases an e\ufb03cient implementation is possible, i.e., in polynomial time by using a linear program solver (e.g., the ellipsoid method (Papadimitriou and Steiglitz, 1998)).  Another interesting open question is to investigate the dependence of regret on quantities other than T such as the number of actions, the number of outcomes, and more generally the structure of the loss and feedback matrices.  Finally, let us note that our results can be extended to a more general framework, similar to that of Pallavi et al. (2011), in which a game with N actions and M -dimensional outcome space is defined as a tuple G = (L, S1, . . . , SN ). The loss matrix is L \u2208 RN \u00d7M as before, but the outcome and the feedback are defined di\ufb00erently. The outcome y is an arbitrary vector from a bounded subset of RM and the feedback received by the learner upon choosing action i is Oi = Siy.
