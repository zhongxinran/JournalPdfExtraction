{"1": "We study algorithms for online linear optimization in Hilbert spaces, focusing on the case where the player is unconstrained.  We develop a novel characterization of a large class of minimax algorithms, recovering, and even improving, several previous results as immediate corollaries.  Moreover, using our tools, we develop an algorithm that provides a regret bound of O(U \\sqrtT \\log( U \\sqrtT \\log^2 T +1)), where U is the L_2 norm of an arbitrary comparator and both T and U are unknown to the player. This bound is optimal up to \\sqrt\\log \\log T terms.  When T is known, we derive an algorithm with an optimal regret bound (up to constant factors).  For both the known and unknown T case, a Normal approximation to the conditional value of the game proves to be the key analysis tool."}
