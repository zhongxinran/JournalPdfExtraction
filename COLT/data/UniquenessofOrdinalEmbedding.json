{"1": "Ordinal embedding refers to the following problem: all we know about an unknown set of \t \t\tpoints x_1,\\ldots, x_n \u2208\\mathbbR^d are ordinal constraints of the form \\|x_i - x_j\\| < \\|x_k - x_l\\|; the task is to construct a realization y_1,\\ldots, y_n \u2208\\mathbbR^d that preserves these ordinal constraints. It has been conjectured since the 1960ies that upon knowledge of all ordinal constraints a large but finite set of points can be approximately reconstructed up to a similarity transformation. The main result of our paper is a formal proof of this conjecture."}
