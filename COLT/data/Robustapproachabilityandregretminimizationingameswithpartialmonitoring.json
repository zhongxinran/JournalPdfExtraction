{"1": "Approachability has become a standard tool in analyzing learning algorithms in the adversarial online learning setup.We develop a variant of approachability for games where there is ambiguity in the obtained reward that belongs to a set, rather than being a single vector. Using this variant we tackle the problem of approachability in games with partial monitoring and develop simple and efficientalgorithms (i.e., with constant per-step complexity) for this setup.We finally consider external and internal regret in repeated games with partial monitoring, for which we deriveregret-minimizing strategies based on approachability theory."}
