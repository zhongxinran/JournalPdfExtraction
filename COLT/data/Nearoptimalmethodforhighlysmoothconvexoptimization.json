{"1": "We propose a near-optimal method for highly smooth convex optimization. More precisely, in the oracle model where one obtains the $p^{th}$ order Taylor expansion of a function at the query point, we propose a method with rate of convergence $\\tilde{O}(1/k^{\\frac{ 3p +1}{2}})$ after $k$ queries to the oracle for any convex function whose $p^{th}$ order derivative is Lipschitz."}
