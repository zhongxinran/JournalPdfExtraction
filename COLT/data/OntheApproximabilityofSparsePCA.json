{"1": "It is well known that Sparse PCA (Sparse Principal Component Analysis) is NP-hard to solve exactly on worst-case instances. What is the complexity of solving Sparse PCA approximately? Our contributions include: \\beginenumerate \\item a simple and efficient algorithm that achieves an n^-1/3-approximation; \\item NP-hardness of approximation to within (1-\\varepsilon), for some small constant \\varepsilon > 0; \\item SSE-hardness of approximation to within \\em any constant factor; and \\item an \\exp\\exp\\left(\u03a9\\left(\\sqrt\\log \\log n\\right)\\right) (\u201cquasi-quasi-polynomial\u201d) gap for the standard semidefinite program. \\endenumerate"}
