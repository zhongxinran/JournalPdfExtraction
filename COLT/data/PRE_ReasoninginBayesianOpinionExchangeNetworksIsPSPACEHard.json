It will be useful to think of OBSi as \u201ccomputing\u201d a logical formula with i \u2212 1 quantifier switches (since from the perspective of this agent blocks xK, . . . , xi+1 are set to fixed values).  \u2022 For each i, there is a (slightly more complicated) gadget similar to the \u201cEVAL-gadget\u201d em- ployed in the 3-SAT reduction. This gadget involves OBSi\u22121 as well as two new agents Bi and Ci and is observed by OBSi. Its purpose is to \u201c\ufb02ip\u201d relative LLRs of different types of variable assignments to implement a quantifier switch.  4. Conclusion  A natural open question is to make progress on the approximate-case hardness in one of the models. For example, one could try to establish NP-hardness for a worst-case network, but holding for signal configurations arising with non-negligible probability. This might require significant new ideas.  Another interesting problem arises from trying to extend our results to the revealed belief model, as discussed in Section D. Thinking in terms of games, consider a class of \u201cno-mistakes-allowed\u201d games: Games where the player with winning strategy always has exactly one winning move, with all alternative moves in a given position leading to a losing position (and this property holding recursively in all positions reachable from the initial one).  Certainly deciding if a position is winning for the first player in such games is in PSPACE. On the other hand, since such a game with all moves performed by the existential player corresponds to a SAT formula with zero or one satisfying assignments, by the Valiant-Vazirani theorem (Valiant and Vazirani, 1986) it is also (morally) NP-hard. This leaves a large gap between NP and PSPACE. For example, suppose we want to prove \u03a02-hardness in the revealed belief model. Then it is natural to consider formulas of the form \u2200x\u2203y : \u03c6(x, y), and the question becomes: How hard is it to distinguish between the cases:  \u2022 YES: For all x, there exists unique yx such that \u03c6(x, yx) = 1. \u2022 NO: There exists unique x0 such that for all y we have \u03c6(x0, y) = 0. For all other x, there  exists unique yx such that \u03c6(x, yx) = 1.  How hard is this problem? In particular, can it be shown to be harder than NP (in some sense)? Hardness of such games can be thought of as a generalization of the Valiant-Vazirani theorem.  We thank Ehsan Emamjomeh-Zadeh for pointing out the PSPACE upper bound.
