Conclusion  This work synthesizes tools from several fields to analyze association rules in a supervised learning framework. This analysis is necessarily di\ufb00erent from that of classical supervised learning analysis; association rules provide two mechanisms for generalization: a large sam- ple, and a minimum support of rules. We considered two simple algorithms, both that create a bound on the support, regulating a tradeo\ufb00 between accuracy on the training set and generalization ability. We have also demonstrated that the adjusted confidence intro- duced here has several advantages over the minimum support threshold that is commonly considered in association rule mining.
