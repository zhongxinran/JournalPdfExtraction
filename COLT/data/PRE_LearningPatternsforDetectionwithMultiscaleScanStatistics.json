Suppose also that hi asymptotically powerful (has diminishing probability of type 1 and type 2 error) if  j \u2264 Lc for some 0 \u2264 c < 1 for all i, j, then the PAMSS is  \u221a  \u00b5 \u2212  2 \u00b7  (cid:80)n (cid:80)n  i=1 v2 hi i=1 vhi  \u2192 \u221e.  (10)  We take this result to mean that as long as the function class, |F|, does not grow exponentially in n, we achieve asymptotic power under the same conditions as if |F| = 1.  Proof We can see this because, under the assumptions, Vn \u2265 Cn log L for some C > 0 and \u221a n = \u03c9(Fn(\u03b4) log log L) making the  Vn/Mn \u2192 0. Furthermore, Fn(\u03b4) = o(  n) and so Mn/  \u221a  \u221a  term involving |F| lower order. Evaluating Mn, Vn gives us the result.  Let us conclude with a remark about the restrictiveness of the assumption that we have a finite function class F. It is known that functions of bounded variation have Haar wavelet coefficients that are bounded in a weak (cid:96)1 norm, Cohen et al. (2003). It is reasonable to discretize the allowed coefficient values and then restrict our function class to functions with k-sparse wavelet coefficients of m then the log-size of the class scales like k log m which is very manageable. One advantage with this approach is that the sparse Haar wavelets will naturally satisfy condition (TVC). It is outside of the scope of this work to extend the result to infinite function classes, but this would present a very interesting and important extension.  6. Conclusions  We have addressed learning and detecting patterns from a function class, F, using multiscale scan statistics. We have introduced the multiscale scan statistic and proved a subexponential concentra- tion bound for it, which relied on a novel chaining result for standardized suprema of subGaussian random fields (a result that may be of independent interest). We introduced the pattern adapted mul- tiscale scan statistic, that can learn patterns in a database of tensors (when the locations and scales vary). This result allowed us to prove Bernstein-type concentration for the PAMSS, meaning that we can learn finite function classes that grow exponentially with the sample size, n. With evidence that representation learning and detection are not incompatible, we anticipate that efficient methods for learning functions in this setting will emerge, by using modern tools from deep learning and multiscale methods.
