{"1": "We study the problem of mean estimation for high-dimensional distributions given access to a statistical query oracle. For a normed space $X = (\\mathbb{R}^d, \\|\\cdot\\|_X)$ and a distribution supported on vectors $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ with $\\|x\\|_{X} \\leq 1$, the task is to output an estimate $\\hat{\\mu} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ which is $\\varepsilon$-close in the distance induced by $\\|\\cdot\\|_X$ to the true mean of the distribution. We obtain sharp upper and lower bounds for the statistical query complexity of this problem when the the underlying norm is \\emph{symmetric} as well as for Schatten-$p$ norms, answering two questions raised by Feldman, Guzm\u00e1n, and Vempala (SODA 2017)."}
