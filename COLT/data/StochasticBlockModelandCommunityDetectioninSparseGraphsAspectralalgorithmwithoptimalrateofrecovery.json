{"1": "In this paper, we present  and analyze  a simple  and robust  spectral algorithm for the stochastic block model with k blocks, for any k fixed.  Our algorithm works with graphs having constant edge density, under an optimal condition on the gap between the density inside a block and the density between the blocks. As a co-product, we settle an open question posed by Abbe et. al. concerning  censor block models."}
