Roughly, self-directed learning is similar to the online learning model corresponding to Littlestone\u2019s dimension, but where the learner chooses the order elements; see Ben-David and Eiron (1998) for details.  25   Inapproximability of VC Dimension and Littlestone\u2019s Dimension  almost matching running time lower bound of nlog1\u2212o(1) n for both problems while ruling out approximation ratios of 1/2 + o(1) and 1 \u2212 \u03b5 for some \u03b5 > 0 for VC Dimension and Littlestone\u2019s Dimension respectively. Even though our results help us gain more insights on approximability of both problems, it is not yet completely resolved. More specifically, we are not aware of any constant factor no(log n)-time approximation algorithm for either problem; it is an intriguing open question whether such algorithm exists and, if not, whether our reduction can be extended to rule out such algorithm. Another potentially interesting research direction is to derandomize our construction; note that the only place in the proof in which the randomness is used is in Lemma 19.  A related question which remains open, originally posed by Ben-David and Eiron Ben-David and Eiron (1998), is that of computing the self-directed learning4 mistake bound. Similarly, it may be interesting to understand the complexity of computing (approximating) the recursive teaching dimension Doliwa et al. (2014); Moran et al. (2015).
