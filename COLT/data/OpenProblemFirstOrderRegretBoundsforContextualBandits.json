{"1": "We describe two open problems related to first order regret bounds for contextual bandits. The first asks for an algorithm with a regret bound of $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{L_\u22c6}K \\ln N)$ where there are $K$ actions, $N$ policies, and $L_\u22c6$ is the cumulative loss of the best policy. The second asks for an optimization-oracle-efficient algorithm with regret $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(L_\u22c6^{2/3}poly(K, \\ln(N/\u03b4)))$.  We describe some positive results, such as an inefficient algorithm for the second problem, and some partial negative results."}
