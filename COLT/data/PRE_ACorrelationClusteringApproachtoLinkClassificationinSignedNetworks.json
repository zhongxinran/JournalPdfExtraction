For instance, O when the input graph G = (VG, EG) has a quadratic number of edges, SCCCC has an amortized time per prediction which is only logarithmic in |VG|. In all cases, both algorithms need linear space in the size of the input graph. In addition, each do-while loop execution within CCCC can be run in parallel.  5. Conclusions and ongoing research  In this paper we initiated a rigorous study of link classification in signed graphs. Motivated by social balance theory, we adopted the correlation clustering index as a natural regularity measure for the problem. We proved upper and lower bounds on the number of prediction mistakes in three fundamental transductive learning models: online, batch and active. Our main algorithmic contribution is for the active model, where we introduced a new family of algorithms based on the notion of circuit covering. Our algorithms are efficient, relatively easy to implement, and have mistake bounds that hold on any signed graph. We are currently working on extensions of our techniques based on recursive decompositions of the input graph. Experiments on social network datasets are also in progress.  References  89-113, 2004.
