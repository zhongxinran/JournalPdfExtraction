{"1": "We investigate the label complexity of active learning under some smoothness assumptions on the data-generating process.We propose a procedure, PLAL, for \u201cactivising\u201d passive, sample-based learners. The procedure takes an unlabeledsample, queries the labels of some of its members, and outputs a full labeling of that sample. Assuming the data satisfies \u201cProbabilistic Lipschitzness\u201d, a notion of clusterability, we show that for several common learning paradigms, applying our procedure as a preprocessing leads to provable label complexity reductions (over any \u201cpassive\u201dlearning algorithm, under the same data assumptions). Our labeling procedure is simple and easy to implement. We complement our theoretical findings with experimental validations."}
