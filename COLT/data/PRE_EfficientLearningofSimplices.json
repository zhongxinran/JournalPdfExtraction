Conclusion  We showed, in two di\ufb00erent ways, that the problem of learning simplices can be solved e\ufb03ciently using techniques for ICA. We also showed that when the sample is one that may not satisfy the requirement of independent components, we can e\ufb03ciently obtain from it a sample that guarantees this property and from which the original distribution can be estimated. Many questions remain: Can we do this for other polytopes? Can we do this when the points come from the Gaussian distribution with labels instead of the uniform distribution in the polytope? In particular, does any one of the two techniques that we used in this paper for learning simplices extend to learning polytopes or to latent variable models?  It is not clear how to extend our method to learn intersections of more than n + 1 half-spaces. The main hurdle seems to be that the nice symmetric form of the moment polynomial that we get for the simplex is no longer there, and it\u2019s not clear how the polyno- mial is related to the features of the polytope. We don\u2019t even know whether or not there is a one-to-one correspondence between polytopes and the moment polynomials (of low constant degree). Interestingly, it is also not clear how to learn intersections of n (or fewer, but not much fewer) half-spaces, for similar reasons: First note that we cannot consider uniform distributions over such sets because they are unbounded. As mentioned before, there is considerable literature when one considers other distributions, such as the Gaussian distri- bution. However, our moment-based method runs into the same di\ufb03culty as before, namely the relation between the moment polynomial and the half-spaces defining the polyhedron is not clear.  As pointed out by a COLT referee, our second method for learning simplices, namely direct reduction to ICA, can possibly be used to learn the more general Dirichlet distribution on the simplex when combined with the results of Barthe et al. (2010). This is an interesting direction for future work.
