However, they considered the distributions with f (x) = (cid:107)x(cid:107)\u03b1 2 and proved geometric convergence of ULA and MALA under some specific conditions. In a more general setting, Bou-Rabee and Hairer (2012) and Eberle (2014) derived non-asymptotic mixing time bounds for MALA. However, all these bounds are non-explicit in the case of logconcave sampling, and so makes it difficult to extract an explicit dependence in terms of the dimension d and error tol- erance \u03b4. In particular, Eberle (2014) made significant contribution to establishing the accept-reject rate of MALA by assuming differentiability of the target function to fourth order, but its final mix- ing rate is only explicit when the sampling domain is contained in a ball with constant radius. A precise characterization of this dependence is needed if one wants to make quantitative comparisons with other algorithms, including ULA and other Langevin-type schemes. With this context, one of the main contributions of our paper is to provide an explicit upper bound on the mixing time of the MALA algorithm.  This work contains two main results, both having to do with the mixing times of MCMC methods for sampling. As described above, our first and primary contribution is an explicit analysis of the mixing time of Metropolis adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA). A second contribution is to use similar techniques to analyze a zeroth-order method called Metropolized random walk (MRW) and derive a explicit non-asymptotic mixing time bound for it. Unlike the ULA, these methods make use of the Metropolis-hastings accept-reject step and consequently converge to the target distributions in the limit of infinite steps. Here we provide explicit non-asymptotic mixing time bounds for MALA and MRW and show that MALA converges significantly faster than ULA. In particular, we show that if the density is strongly log-concave and smooth, the \u03b4-mixing time for MALA scales as \u03bad log(1/\u03b4) which is significantly faster than ULA\u2019s convergence rate of order \u03ba2d/\u03b42. We also show that MRW mixes O (\u03bad) slowly when compared to MALA. Furthermore, if the density is weakly log-concave, we show that MALA converges in O (cid:0)d2/\u03b41.5(cid:1) time in comparison to the O (cid:0)d3/\u03b44(cid:1) mixing time for ULA. These results are summarized in Table 1.

Scalings of upper bounds on \u03b4-mixing time for different random walks in Rd with target \u03c0 \u221d e\u2212f . In the second column, we consider smooth and strongly log-concave densities, and report the bounds from a \u03b2-warm start for densities such that mId (cid:22) \u22072f (x) (cid:22) LId for any x \u2208 Rd and use \u03ba := L/m to denote the condition number of the density. The big-O notation hides universal constants. In the last column, we summarize the scaling for weakly log-concave smooth densities: 0 (cid:22) \u22072f (x) (cid:22) LId for all x \u2208 Rd. For this case, the \u02dcO notation is used to track scaling only with respect to d, \u03b4 and L and ignore dependence on the starting distribution and a few other parameters.
