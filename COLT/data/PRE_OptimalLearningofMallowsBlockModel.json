This theorem states that the total variation of two distributions in the same exponential family is equal to the distance between their parameters times the absolute deviation of a corresponding distribution in the family. This should be compared with the expression of the KL-divergence between two distributions in the same exponential fam- ily. Then our lower bound boils down to showing that for some range of parameters, the absolute deviation is within a constant from the standard deviation. With this proven, we get that the total variation distance is within a constant factor from the square root of the KL-divergence, and Fano\u2019s inequality can be applied.
