(2015), finding a point in the convex hull (even for d = 1) requires sam- ple complexity \u2126(log\u2217 T ). Thus, together we get a lower bound on the sample complexity of \u2126( d  \u03b5 log 1 It may be tempting to guess that, even with pure (\u03b5, 0)-differential privacy, a sample complexity of O(log |X|) = O(d log T ) should suffice for solving this task, as the size of the output space is T d, because S \u2286 [T ]d, and hence (it seems) that one could privately solve this problem using the exponential mechanism of McSherry and Talwar (2007) with sample complexity that depends logarithmically on the size of the output space. We show that this is not the case, and that any (\u03b5, 0)-differentially private algorithm for this task must have sample complexity \u2126( d2  \u03b5 log T ).  Theorem 24 Let T \u2265 2, and d \u2265 10. Let A be an (\u03b5, \u03b4)-differentially private algorithm that takes a database S \u2286 [T ]d of size m and returns, with probability at least 1/2, a non-trivial linear combination of the points in S. Then, m = \u2126 min  (cid:110) d2  (cid:111)(cid:17)  (cid:16)  .  \u03b5 log T, d  \u03b5 log 1  \u03b4  The proof of Theorem 24 builds on the analysis of Blum et al. (2008) for lower bounding the sample complexity of releasing approximate answers for counting queries. See the full version of this work for more details.  Acknowledgments  A. B. and K.
