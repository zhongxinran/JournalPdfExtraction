Then, for each child node, independently of everything else, it has the same attribute with its parent with probability 1 \u2212 (r \u2212 1)(cid:15)((cid:96)) and one of r \u2212 1 different attributes with probability (cid:15)((cid:96)), where  (cid:15)((cid:96)) =  b\u03bd((cid:96)) a\u00b5((cid:96)) + (r \u2212 1)b\u03bd((cid:96))  .  (19)  Recall that GR denote the neighborhood of \u03c1 in G within distance R and \u2202GR denote the nodes at the boundary of GR. Let TR denote the tree T up to depth R and \u2202TR denote the set of leaf nodes of TR. The following lemma similar to coupling lemmas in Mossel et al. (2012) and Lelarge et al. (2013) shows that GR can be coupled with the labeled Galton-Watson tree TR.  Lemma 6 Let R = \u03b8 log n for some small enough constant \u03b8 > 0, then there exists a coupling such that a.a.s. (GR, \u03c3GR) = (TR, \u03c3TR), where \u03c3GR denote the node attributes on the subgraph GR.  For the labeled Galton-Watson tree, we show that if \u03c9 < \u03c90, then the attributes of leaf nodes  are asymptotically independent with the attribute of root.  Lemma 7 Consider a labeled Galton-Waltson tree T with \u03c9 < \u03c90. Then as R \u2192 \u221e,  \u2200x \u2208 {1, . . . , r}, P(\u03c3\u03c1 = x|T , \u03c3\u2202TR) \u2192  a.a.s.  1 r  By exploiting Lemma 6 and Lemma 7, we give our proof of Theorem 3. By symmetry, P[\u03c3\u03c1 = x|G, \u03c3v = y] = P[\u03c3\u03c1 = x(cid:48)|G, \u03c3v = y] for x, x(cid:48) (cid:54)= y and x (cid:54)= x(cid:48). Therefore, we only need to show that P[\u03c3\u03c1 = y|G, \u03c3v = y] \u223c 1/r for any y \u2208 X and it further reduces to showing that  P[\u03c3\u03c1 = y|G, \u03c3v = y, \u03c3\u2202GR] \u223c 1/r.  (20)  Let R = \u03b8 log n be as in Lemma 6 such that GR = o( n) and thus v /\u2208 GR a.a.s.. Lemma 4.7 in Mossel et al. (2012) shows that \u03c3\u03c1 is asymptotically independent with \u03c3v conditional on \u03c3\u2202GR. Hence, P[\u03c3\u03c1 = y|G, \u03c3v = y, \u03c3\u2202GR] \u223c P[\u03c3\u03c1 = y|G, \u03c3\u2202GR]. Also, note that P(\u03c3\u03c1 = y|G, \u03c3\u2202GR) = P(\u03c3\u03c1 = y|GR, \u03c3\u2202GR). Lemma 6 implies that P(\u03c3\u03c1 = y|GR, \u03c3GR) \u223c P(\u03c3\u03c1 = y|TR, \u03c3\u2202TR), and by Lemma 7, P(\u03c3\u03c1 = y|TR, \u03c3\u2202TR) \u223c 1  r . Therefore, equation (20) holds.  \u221a  M.L acknowledges the support of the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) under refer- ence ANR-11-JS02-005-01 (GAP project). J.
