In nonlinear space, we have not been able to find an analogy to such a projection. Further study is needed to see if similar anal- ysis can be developed, or a different approach is required, or Nesterov\u2019s algorithms have no nonlinear space counterparts.  \u2022 Another interesting direction is variance reduced stochastic gradient methods for geodesically convex functions. For smooth and convex optimization in Euclidean space, these methods have recently drawn great interests and enjoyed remarkable empirical success. We hypoth- esize that similar algorithms can achieve faster convergence over naive incremental gradient methods on Hadamard manifolds.  \u2022 Finally, since in applications it is often favorable to replace exponential mapping with com- putationally cheap retractions, it is important to understand the effect of this approximation on convergence rate. Analyzing this effect is of both theoretical and practical interests.  Acknowledgments  We thank the anonymous reviewers for helpful suggestions.
