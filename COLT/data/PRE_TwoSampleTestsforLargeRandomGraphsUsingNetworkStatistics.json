For instance, concentration of functions like clustering coefficient and modularity in combination with our results will help to theoretically validate various claims about properties of brain networks.  \u2022 Bootstrapped variant of proposed two-sample test  The proposed test primarily relies on concentration of the test statistic (5) under the null and alternative hypotheses. It is often observed that the practical performance of concentration based tests can be improved by using bootstrapped variants (Gretton et al., 2012; Tang et al., 2017). In the present context, we feel that bootstrapping can help to achieve low error rate even for smaller and sparser graphs.  However, bootstrapping is a challenging problem in the present setting. Gretton et al. (2012) consider a large population problem, where random mixing of the two population helps to estimate the null distribution for the test statistic. Tang et al. (2017) deal with the two graph setting, but the assumption that the graphs are generated from RDPG model allows parameter estimation, which in turn, aids in generating bootstrapped samples from the estimated models. It would be interesting to come up with bootstrapping procedures without such assumptions.  The work of D.
