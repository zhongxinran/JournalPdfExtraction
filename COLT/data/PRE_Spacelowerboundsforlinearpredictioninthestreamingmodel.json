We show that if A is a protocol for finding a linear separator, there exists a protocol A(cid:48) for finding an approximate null vector with the same amount of communication.  Here is how A(cid:48) is created, based on A. The first party, given V \u2208 Gr(d/2, d), creates an auxiliary distribution DV over pairs (x, y), with the following property: Any hyperplane w \u2208 Sd\u22121 with low classification error on DV , satisfies (cid:107)ProjV (w)(cid:107)2 \u2248 0. Similarly, the second party will create an auxiliary distribution DU , such that any approximate separator w satisfies (cid:107)ProjU (w)(cid:107)2 \u2248 0. In particular, any hyperplane with low error on the uniform mixture of DV and DU satisfies: (cid:107)ProjV (w)(cid:107)2 + (cid:107)ProjU (w)(cid:107)2 \u2248 0.  Each party draws m = \u2126(d) samples from their corresponding distribution (DV or DU ). Then, they simulate A to find a hyperplane \u02c6w with low classification error on the mixed sample. Since the class of linear separators over Rd is of VC dimension d, \u02c6w has low classification error on the mixture of DV and DU , hence it satisfies (cid:107)ProjV (w)(cid:107)2 + (cid:107)ProjU (w)(cid:107)2 \u2248 0, as required. Lemma 5 states that the communication of A(cid:48) is \u2126(d2), hence the communication of A is \u2126(d2) as well.  Here is how a random pair (x, y) is drawn from DV (DU is analogously defined): First a random point x(cid:48) is drawn uniformly from V \u2229 Sd\u22121. Then, set (x, y) = (x+, 1) with probability 1/2 and (x, y) = (x\u2212, \u22121) with probability 1/2, where x+ = x(cid:48) + \u0398(e1/ d). For any fixed w \u2208 Sd\u22121, if x is drawn uniformly from V \u2229 Sd\u22121 then w(cid:62)x \u223c N (0, (cid:107)ProjV (w)(cid:107)2) (approximately, see Lemma 24). From the definition of DV , any hyperplane w with low clas- sification error on DV satisfies w(cid:62)x \u2248 0 for most x \u2208 V \u2229 Sd\u22121, hence any such w satisfies (cid:107)ProjV (w)(cid:107)2 \u2248 0, as required.  d) and x\u2212 = x(cid:48) \u2212 \u0398(e1/  \u221a  \u221a  This research is supported in part by European Research Council (ERC) grant 754705.
