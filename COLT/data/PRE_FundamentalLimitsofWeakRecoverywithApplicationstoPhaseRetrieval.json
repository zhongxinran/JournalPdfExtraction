Here optimality is understood with respect to the weak recovery threshold.  4   FUNDAMENTAL LIMITS OF WEAK RECOVERY WITH APPLICATIONS TO PHASE RETRIEVAL  The lower bound is proved by estimating the conditional entropy via the second moment method. The spectral algorithm computes the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of a  matrix of the form:  Dn =  T (yi)aia\u2217 i ,  1 n  n (cid:88)  i=1  (9)  (10)  where T : R \u2192 R is a pre-processing function. For \u03b4 large enough (and a suitable choice of T ), we expect the resulting eigenvector \u02c6x(y) to be positively correlated with the true signal x. The recent paper (Lu and Li, 2017) computed exactly the threshold value \u03b4u, under the assumption that the measurement vectors are real Gaussian, and T is non-negative.  Here, we generalize the result of (Lu and Li, 2017) by removing the assumption that T (y) \u2265 0 and by considering the complex case. Armed with this result, we compute the optimal2 pre- processing function T \u2217 \u03b4 (y) for the general model (1). Our upper bound \u03b4u is the phase transition In the case of phase retrieval (as \u03c3 \u2192 0), this pre- location for this optimal spectral method. processing function is given by  T \u2217 \u03b4 (y) =  y \u2212 1 \u221a  ,  y +  \u03b4 \u2212 1  and achieves weak recovery for any \u03b4 > \u03b4u = 1. In the limit \u03b4 \u2193 1, this converges to the limiting function T \u2217(y) = 1 \u2212 (1/y).  While the expression (10) is remarkably simple, it is somewhat counter-intuitive. Earlier meth- ods (Cand\u00e8s et al., 2015c; Chen and Cand\u00e8s, 2015; Lu and Li, 2017) use T (y) \u2265 0 and try to extract information from the large values of yi. The function (10) has a large negative part for small y, in particular when \u03b4 is close to 1. Furthermore, it extracts useful information from data points with yi small. One possible interpretation is that the points in which the measurement vector is basically orthogonal to the unknown signal are not informative, hence we penalize them.  Our analysis applies to Gaussian measurement matrices. However, the proposed spectral method  works well also on real images and realistic measurement matrices.  We also compare our spectral approach to message passing algorithms. In particular, we prove that, for \u03b4 < \u03b4u (i.e. in the regime in which the spectral approach fails), message passing converges to an un-informative fixed point, even if initialized in a state that is correlated with the true signal x. Vice versa, for \u03b4 > \u03b4u (i.e. in the regime in which the spectral approach achieves weak recovery), we consider a linearized message passing algorithm, and prove that the un-informative fixed point is unstable.
