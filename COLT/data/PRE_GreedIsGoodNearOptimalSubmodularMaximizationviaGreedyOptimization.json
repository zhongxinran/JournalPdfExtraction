Because mg = 1, we are constrained here to have at most one movie from Adventure, Animation and Fantasy. As seen in Figure 2, FANTOM and SAMPLEGREEDY return maximum size solution sets that are both diverse and representative of these genres. On the other hand, Greedy gets stuck choosing a single movie that belongs to all three genres, thus, precluding any other choice of movie from the solution set.  Finally, we would like to make a short remark on the relation between our theoretical analy- sis and experimental results. In our analysis, we showed that SAMPLEGREEDY achieves a better expected approximation ratio than the worst-case approximation ratio of REPEATEDGREEDY and FANTOM. However, there are many problem instances which are \u201cnot hard\u201d, and do not make the algorithms exhibit their worst-case behavior. For such instances, REPEATEDGREEDY and FAN- TOM may out-perform SAMPLEGREEDY. Our experiments demonstrate that even in usual \u201cnot hard\u201d problem instances, SAMPLEGREEDY performs competitively at a fraction of the computa- tional cost, indicating its potential for real-world large scale applications.
