Furthermore, it can be shown that T1 = OP (\u03bb), T2 = op(T1), and T3 = oP (T1) . Then with probability at least 1 \u2212 e\u2212n\u03b4n,  sup f0\u2208B  (cid:107) (cid:98)fR \u2212 f0(cid:107)2 n  (cid:38) sup f0\u2208B  (cid:107) E(cid:15) (cid:98)fR \u2212 f0(cid:107)2  n (cid:29) C\u03bb\u2020.  Our second result is about the sharpness of s\u2217. Theorem 4.8 shows that when s (cid:28) s\u2217, there exists a local alternative f that is not detectable by Tn,\u03bb even when it is separated from zero by d\u2217 n. In this case, the asymptotic testing power is actually smaller than the nominal level \u03b1.  Theorem 4.8 Suppose s = o(s\u2217). Then there exists an s \u00d7 n projection matrix S satisfying Assumption A3 and a positive nonrandom sequence \u03b2n,\u03bb satisfying limn\u2192\u221e \u03b2n,\u03bb = \u221e such that, with probability at least 1 \u2212 e\u2212cn\u03b4n \u2212 e\u2212c1s \u2212 e\u2212c2s\u03bb,  lim sup n\u2192\u221e  inf f \u2208B (cid:107)f (cid:107)n\u2265\u03b2n,\u03bbd\u2217 n  Pf (\u03c6n,\u03bb = 1|x, S) \u2264 \u03b1,  where c is a constant independent of n, and c1, c2 \u2208 (0, \u221e] are given in Assumption A3 (b). Recall 1 \u2212 \u03b1 is the significance level.  The proof of Theorem 4.8 is similar as that of Theorem 4.7, except that a different true function i=1 K(xi, \u00b7)wi with w = (w1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , wn)(cid:62) = U \u03b1, where \u03b1 \u2208 Rn satisfies  is constructed as f (\u00b7) = (cid:80)n  \u03b12  i =  (cid:40) 1 n 0  C  s\u22121 (cid:98)\u00b5\u22121  gs+k  for i = (gs + k) k = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , s \u2212 1; otherwise,  (4.5)  with g \u2265 1 as an integer satisfying (g + 1)s (cid:28) s\u2217; see"}
