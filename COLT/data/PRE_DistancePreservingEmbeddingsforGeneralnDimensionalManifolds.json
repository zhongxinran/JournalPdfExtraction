Properties of a Well-conditioned Manifold  Throughout this section we will assume that M is a compact submanifold of RD of dimension n, and condition number 1/\u03c4 . The following are some properties of such a manifold that would be useful throughout the text.  Lemma 16 (relating closeby tangent vectors \u2013 implicit in the proof of Proposition 6.2 Niyogi et al. (2006)) Pick any two (path-connected) points p, q \u2208 M . Let u \u2208 TpM be a unit length tangent vector and v \u2208 TqM be its parallel transport along the (shortest) geodesic path to q. Then2, i) u \u00b7 v \u2265 1 \u2212 DG(p, q)/\u03c4 , ii) (cid:107)u \u2212 v(cid:107) \u2264 (cid:112)2DG(p, q)/\u03c4 .  2. Technically, it is not possible to directly compare two vectors that reside in different tangent spaces. However, since we only deal with manifolds that are immersed in some ambient space, we can treat the tangent spaces as n-dimensional af\ufb01ne subspaces. We can thus parallel translate the vectors to the origin of the ambient space, and do the necessary comparison (such as take the dot product, etc.). We will make a similar abuse of notation for any calculation that uses vectors from different af\ufb01ne subspaces to mean to \ufb01rst translate the vectors and then perform the necessary calculation.  32.13   DISTANCE PRESERVING EMBEDDINGS FOR MANIFOLDS  References  tional Mathematics, 2007.
