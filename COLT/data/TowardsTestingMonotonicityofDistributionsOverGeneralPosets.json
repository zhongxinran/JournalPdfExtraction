{"1": "In this work, we consider the sample complexity required for testing the monotonicity of distributions over partial orders.  A distribution $p$ over a poset is {\\em monotone} if, for any pair of domain elements $x$ and $y$ such that $x \\preceq y$, $p(x) \\leq p(y)$. To understand the sample complexity of this problem, we introduce a new property called \\emph{bigness} over a finite domain, where the distribution is $T$-big if the minimum probability for any domain element is at least $T$. We establish a lower bound of $\\Omega(n/\\log n)$ for testing bigness of distributions on  domains of size $n$. We then build on  these lower bounds to give $\\Omega(n/\\log{n})$ lower bounds for  testing monotonicity over a matching poset of size $n$ and significantly improved lower bounds over the hypercube poset. We give sublinear sample complexity bounds for testing bigness and for testing monotonicity over the matching poset.   We then give a number of tools for analyzing upper bounds on the sample complexity of the monotonicity testing problem."}
