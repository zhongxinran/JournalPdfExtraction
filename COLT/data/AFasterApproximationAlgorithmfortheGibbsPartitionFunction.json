{"1": "We consider the problem of estimating the partition function $Z(\\beta)=\\sum_x \\exp(-\\beta H(x))$ of a Gibbs distribution with a Hamilton $H(\\cdot)$, or more precisely the logarithm of the ratio $q=\\ln Z(0)/Z(\\beta)$. It has been recently shown how to approximate $q$ with high probability assuming the existence of an oracle that produces samples from the Gibbs distribution for a given parameter value in $[0,\\beta]$. The current best known approach due to Huber (2015) uses $O(q\\ln n\\cdot[\\ln q + \\ln \\ln n+\\varepsilon^{-2}])$  oracle calls on average where $\\varepsilon$ is the desired accuracy of approximation and $H(\\cdot)$ is assumed to lie in $\\{0\\}\\cup[1,n]$. We improve the complexity to $O(q\\ln n\\cdot\\varepsilon^{-2})$ oracle calls. We also show that the same complexity can be achieved if exact oracles are replaced with approximate sampling oracles that are within $O(\\frac{\\varepsilon^2}{q\\ln n})$ variation distance from exact oracles. Finally, we prove a lower bound of $\\Omega(q\\cdot \\varepsilon^{-2})$ oracle calls under a natural model of computation."}
