This singular value thresholding step enforces that all the singular values of the Gramian matrix inverted in (8) deviate from their expected values by at most 1 \u2212 \u03b2 after proper normalization, and as a result, guarantees the nonsingularity of this (adjusted) Gramian matrix. The convergence of the algorithm relies on the fact that w.h.p. the number of times the algorithm applies the operation T2 in each iteration is a small fraction of n. Also, the operators T1 are applied at the end of each iteration to guarantee the incoherence of the input V t+1 (or U t+1) for the next iteration while maintaining that V t+1 (or U t+1) is still close enough to V \u2217 (or U \u2217).  ,  j  j  Our main result concerns the performance of the algorithm T AM under Assumption 1 and  under both Assumptions 1 and 2, respectively. We recall that T AM is parameterized by \u03b4 and \u03b2.  Theorem 1 Suppose M \u2208 Rn\u00d7n is a rank-k matrix satisfying Assumption 1. Suppose the observed index set \u2126 is sampled according to the model RRG(d, n, N ) in (6). Given any \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1), \u03b2 \u2208 (0, 1 \u2212 \u03b4) and (cid:15) \u2208 (0, 2/3), there exists a C(\u03b4, \u03b2) > 0 such that for  d \u2265 C(\u03b4, \u03b2)k4\u00b52 0  (cid:19)2  (cid:18) \u03c3\u2217 1 \u03c3\u2217 k  +  5\u00b50k(1 + \u03b4/3) \u03b42  log  (cid:19)  (cid:18) 1 (cid:15)  and N \u2265 1 + (cid:100)log( 2 MN (cid:107)F \u2264 (cid:15)(cid:107)M (cid:107)F w.h.p.  (cid:15) )/ log 4(cid:101), the T AM algorithm produces a matrix MN satisfying (cid:107)M \u2212  Furthermore, suppose M satisfies both Assumptions 1 and 2. Then for \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1) as defined in  Assumption 2 and \u03b2 \u2208 (0, 1 \u2212 \u03b4), the same result holds when  (11)  (12)  d \u2265 C(\u03b4, \u03b2)k4\u00b52 0  (cid:19)2  ,  (cid:18) \u03c3\u2217 1 \u03c3\u2217 k  for the same constant C(\u03b4, \u03b2) in (11).  Theorem 1 states that under Assumption 1 the T AM algorithm produces a rank-k (cid:15)-approximation  of matrix M using O(dn log(1/(cid:15))) samples for d satisfying (11). Furthermore, under both Assump- tion 1 and Assumption 2 the T AM algorithm produces a rank-k (cid:15)-approximation of matrix M using O(dn log(1/(cid:15))) samples for d satisfying (12).
