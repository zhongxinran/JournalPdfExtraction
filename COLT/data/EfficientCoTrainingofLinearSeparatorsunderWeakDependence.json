{"1": "We develop the first polynomial-time algorithm for co-training of homogeneous linear separators under \\em weak dependence, a relaxation of the condition of independence given the label. Our algorithm learns from purely unlabeled data, except for a single labeled example to break symmetry of the two classes, and works for any data distribution having an inverse-polynomial margin and with center of mass at the origin."}
