{"1": "We study a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation of the maximum likelihood estimation for exactly recovering a hidden community of cardinality K from an n \\times n symmetric data matrix A, where for distinct indices i,j, A_ij \u223cP if i, j are both in the community and A_ij \u223cQ otherwise, for two known probability distributions P and Q. We identify a  sufficient condition  and a  necessary condition for the success of SDP  for the general model. For both the Bernoulli case (P=\\rm Bern(p) and Q=\\rm Bern(q) with p>q) and the Gaussian case (P=\\mathcalN(\u03bc,1) and Q=\\mathcalN(0,1) with \u03bc>0), which correspond to the problem of planted dense subgraph recovery and submatrix localization respectively, the general results lead to the following findings: (1) If K=\u03c9( n /\\log n), SDP attains the information-theoretic recovery limits with sharp constants; (2) If K=\u0398(n/\\log n), SDP is order-wise optimal, but strictly suboptimal by a constant factor; (3) If K=o(n/\\log n) and K \\to \u221e, SDP is order-wise suboptimal. The same critical scaling for K is found to hold, up to constant factors, for the performance of SDP on the stochastic block model of n vertices partitioned into multiple communities of equal size K. A key ingredient in the proof of the necessary condition is a construction of a primal feasible solution based on random perturbation of the true cluster matrix."}
