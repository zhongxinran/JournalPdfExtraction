Discussion and Future Work  We have generalized the notion of memoryless sequences of Nobel (2004) to higher dimensions and differentiable losses. We conclude that memoryless sequences are characterized by the stochas- tic behavior of their finite dimensional weak limits, and that the the distribution of these limits is governed by the property elicited by the loss function. In particular, the broad class of Bregman divergences share the same set of memoryless sequences with squared loss, and their weak limits form martingale difference sequences. Finally, we showed how these results can show that prices in prediction markets are calibrated (or traders can make infinite profits).  A promising future direction would be to extend these results to non-differentiable losses, if possible. This would allow for losses eliciting the median, as all losses eliciting the median, such as absolute loss (cid:96)(x, y) = |x\u2212y|, are nondifferentiable (Gneiting, 2011). As mentioned in Section 5, it would also be interesting to extend our results to a more online setting, where the outcome sequence can adapt to the predictions adversarially, a setting closer to game-theoretic probability.
