Indyk, A. Vakilian and T. Wagner were supported by funds from the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, NSF, and Simons Foundation. D. Woodruff was supported partly by the National Science Foun- dation under Grant No. CCF-1815840, and this work was done partly while he was visiting the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing. The authors would also like to thank Ainesh Bakshi for implementing the algorithm in this paper and producing our empirical results.  References  Ainesh Bakshi and David Woodruff.
