In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28: Annual  12   Testing Monotonicity of Distributions  dition is su\ufb03cient for the distribution to be monotone in the induced subgraph G[B [ T ]. The tester accepts when it cannot rule out the possibility that T has the maximum possible probability mass. Recall that if the distribution is \u03f5-far from monotone, there must exist a large matching of \\violated\" edges. To this end, we show that the induced subgraph G[B [ T ] contains many disjoint violated edges, implying that there are many vertices in T outside of the support: the probability mass on T will be noticeably small and the tester will reject.  Upper bound via trying all matchings. In Section E.5 we give another upper bound for testing monotonicity of a distribution with respect to a bipartite graph which, in this case, has a small number of induced subgraphs that contains a perfect matching of their vertices. In particular, we show that O( log M ) samples are su\ufb03cient for this task, where M \u03f52 is the number of such induced subgraphs. We note that this bound matches the general learning upper bound of O(n=\u03f52) when M attains its maximum value of 2(cid:2)(n), but can potentially be better when M is asymptotically smaller. The main idea of our tester is as follows: if the distribution is \u03f5-far from monotone, there exists a matching of violated edges that is (cid:2)(\u03f5)-far from monotone. Hence, for each subgraph of G that admits a perfect matching, we may approximate the weight (violation amount) of this matching by simply comparing the total probability masses between the top part and the bottom part of the subgraph. We approximate these masses with error probability O(1=M ) for each subgraph, which allows us to apply a union bound over all subgraphs at the end. Our tester rejects if the weight of one such subgraph exceeds \u03f5, or accepts otherwise.
