{"1": "In this paper, we propose and study a semi-random model for the Correlation Clustering problem on arbitrary graphs G. We give two approximation algorithms for Correlation Clustering instances from this model. The first algorithm finds a solution of value (1+ \u03b4)\\mathrmopt-cost + O_\u03b4(n\\log^3 n) with high probability, where \\mathrmopt-cost is the value of the optimal solution (for every \u03b4> 0). The second algorithm finds the ground truth clustering with an arbitrarily small classification error \u03b7(under some additional assumptions on the instance)."}
