{"1": "We prove a new structural lemma for partial Boolean functions \\emphf, which we call the \\emphseed lemma for \\emphDNF. Using the lemma, we give the first subexponential algorithm for proper learning of poly(\\emphn)-term DNF in Angluin\u2019s Equivalence Query (EQ) model. The algorithm has time and query complexity 2^(\u00d5\u221a\\emphn), which is optimal. We also give a new result on certificates for DNF-size, a simple algorithm for properly PAC-learning DNF, and new results on EQ-learning log \\emphn-term DNF and decision trees."}
