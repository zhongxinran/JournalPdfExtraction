In order to translate a 2-sorted con- junctive query \u03c6 over pentagons to a conjunctive query \u03c6(cid:48) over A, the relations \u03b2 and \u03b3 are used to simulate the two sorts, and the relation \u03b1 is used to simulate the behavior of the relation R. Also, in the resulting conjunctive query \u03c6(cid:48), all of the variables are related by the relation DU (where U is the total number of variables), effectively localizing \u03c6(cid:48) to the pentagons found in the set P.
