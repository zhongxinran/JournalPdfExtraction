{"1": "We consider binary classification problems with positive definite kernels and square loss, and study the convergence rates of stochastic gradient methods. We show that while the excess testing \\emph{loss} (squared loss) converges slowly to zero as the number of observations (and thus iterations) goes to infinity, the testing \\emph{error} (classification error) converges exponentially fast if low-noise conditions are assumed. To achieve these rates of convergence we show sharper high-probability bounds with respect to the number of observations for stochastic gradient descent."}
