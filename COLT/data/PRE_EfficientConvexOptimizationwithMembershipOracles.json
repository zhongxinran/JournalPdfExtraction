Our main result in this paper is an algorithm that minimizes a convex function over a convex set using only \u02dcO(n2) membership and evaluation queries. Interestingly, we obtain this result by first showing that we can implement a separation oracle for a convex set and a subgradient ora- cle for a function using only \u02dcO(n) membership queries and then using the known reduction from optimization to separation. We state the result informally below.  \u221a  n for more  Theorem 1 Let K be a convex set specified by a membership oracle, a point x0 \u2208 Rn, and numbers 0 < r < R such that B(x0, r) \u2286 K \u2286 B(x0, R). For any convex function f given by an evaluation oracle and (cid:15) > 0, there is a randomized algorithm that computes a point z \u2208 B(K, (cid:15)) such that  f (z) \u2264 min x\u2208K  f (x) + (cid:15)  max x\u2208K  f (x) \u2212 min x\u2208K  f (x)  (cid:18)  (cid:19)  with constant probability using O(n2 logO(1)( nR oracle and O(n3 logO(1)( nR  (cid:15)r )) total arithmetic operations.
