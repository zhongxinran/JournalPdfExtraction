{"1": "We present a private agnostic learner for halfspaces over an arbitrary finite domain $X\\subset \\R^d$ with sample complexity $\\mathsf{poly}(d,2^{\\log^*|X|})$. The building block for this learner is a differentially private algorithm for locating an approximate center point of $m>\\mathsf{poly}(d,2^{\\log^*|X|})$ points \u2013 a high dimensional generalization of the median function. Our construction establishes a relationship between these two problems that is reminiscent of the relation between the median and learning one-dimensional thresholds [Bun et al. FOCS \u201915]. This relationship suggests that the problem of privately locating a center point may have further applications in the design of differentially private algorithms. We also provide a lower bound on the sample complexity for privately finding a point in the convex hull. For approximate  differential privacy, we show a lower bound of $m=\\Omega(d+\\log^*|X|)$, whereas for pure differential privacy $m=\\Omega(d\\log|X|)$."}
