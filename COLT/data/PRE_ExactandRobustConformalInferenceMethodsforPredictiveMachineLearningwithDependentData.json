For example, it is well known that any stationary Markov chains that are Harris recurrent and ape- riodic are strong mixing. Many common serially dependent processes such as ARMA with i.i.d. innovations can also be shown to be strong mixing.  4. Conclusion  This paper extends the applicability of conformal inference to general settings that allow for time series data. Our results are developed within the general framework of randomization inference. Our method is based on a carefully-designed randomization approach based on groups of permutations, which exhibit a block structure to account for the potential serial dependence in the data. When the data are i.i.d. or more generally exchangeable, our method exhibits exact, model-free validity. When the exchangeability condition does not hold, finite-sample performance bounds can still be obtained under weak conditions on the conformity score as long as transformations of the data serve as meaningful approximations for a stationary series.
