Could we still make strong, provable guarantees for application-specific algorithm configuration in this scenario? This work also leaves open the potential for data-dependent bounds over well-behaved distributions, such as those over clustering instances satisfying some form of stability, be it approximation stability, perturbation resilience, or so on.
