{"1": "We study the stochastic continuum-armed bandit problem from the angle of adaptivity to \\emph{unknown regularity} of the reward function $f$. We prove that there exists no strategy for the cumulative regret that adapts optimally to the \\emph{smoothness} of $f$. We show however that such minimax optimal adaptive strategies exist if the learner is given \\emph{extra-information} about $f$. Finally, we complement our positive results with matching lower bounds."}
