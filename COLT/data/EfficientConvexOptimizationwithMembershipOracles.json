{"1": "We consider the problem of minimizing a convex function over a convex set given access only to an evaluation oracle for the function and a membership oracle for the set. We give a simple algorithm which solves this problem with $\\tilde{O}(n^{2})$ oracle calls and $\\tilde{O}(n^{3})$ additional arithmetic operations. Using this result, we obtain more efficient reductions among the five basic oracles for convex sets and functions defined by Gr{\u00f6}tschel, Lov{\u00e1}sz, and Schrijver (1988)."}
