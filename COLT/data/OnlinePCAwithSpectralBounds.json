{"1": "This paper revisits the online PCA problem. Given a stream of n vectors x_t \u2208\\mathbbR^d (columns of X) the algorithm must output y_t \u2208\\mathbbR^\\ell  (columns of Y) before receiving x_t+1. The goal of online PCA is to simultaneously minimize the target dimension \\ell and the error \\|X - (XY^\\scriptstyle  \\textrm +)Y\\|^2. We describe two simple and deterministic algorithms. The first, receives a parameter \u2206and guarantees that \\|X - (XY^\\scriptstyle  \\textrm +)Y\\|^2 is not significantly larger than \u2206. It requires a target dimension of \\ell = O(k/\u03b5) for any k,\u03b5such that \u2206\\ge \u03b5\\sigma_1^2 + \\sigma_k+1^2, with \\sigma_i being the i\u2019th singular value of X. The second receives k and \u03b5and guarantees that \\|X - (XY^\\scriptstyle  \\textrm +)Y\\|^2 \\le \u03b5\\sigma_1^2 + \\sigma_k+1^2. It requires a target dimension of O( k\\log n/\u03b5^2). Different models and algorithms for Online PCA were considered in the past. This is the first that achieves a bound on the spectral norm of the residual matrix."}
