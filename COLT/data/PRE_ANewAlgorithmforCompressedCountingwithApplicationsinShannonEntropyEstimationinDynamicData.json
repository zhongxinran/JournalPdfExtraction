Conclusion  Many machine learning (e.g., neural computation, graph estimation) and data mining (e.g., anomaly detection) problems require estimating the Shannon entropy. When the data are dynamic (e.g., data streams), e\ufb03cient estimation of the Shannon entropy using small space has been a challenging problem. It is known that we can approximate the Shannon entropy using the \u03b1-th frequency moment of the stream with \u03b1 very close to 1, if the estimator of the moment is accurate enough with variance proportional to O(\u22062), where \u2206 = |1 \u2212 \u03b1|. Our paper provides such a practical estimator. Our method is an ideal solution to the problem of entropy estimation when the data streams follow the strict-Turnstile model.  For \u03bd-additive Shannon entropy estimation, the sample complexity of the algorithm is only O (cid:0) 1 (cid:1). The constant factor for this bound is merely about 6. In addition, we prove \u03bd2 that our algorithm achieves an upper bound of the Fisher information and in fact it is close to 100% statistically optimal. An empirical study is also conducted to verify the accuracy of our algorithm.  Further research: To further reduce the processing cost in order to better accommodate high-rate data streams, it is desirable to replace the dense matrix of skewed stable variables by a sparse matrix of Pareto-type variables. This is closely related to the prior study of very sparse symmetric stable random projections (Li, 2007). However, the extension to CC requires further work.
