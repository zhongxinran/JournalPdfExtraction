For each variable, we constrain its basis to be a special rotation of the reference basis. The rotation is special in the sense that it is a set of identical rotations in k pairs of two-dimensional subspaces. Because a rotation in two dimensions has exactly two configurations, rotate clockwise or rotate counter-clockwise, there are only two possible rotations of the variable\u2019s basis. We interpret each of these rotations as setting the variable to +1 or \u22121.  For each clause in \u03a6, the clause gadget is a set of constraints that are intended to construct a vector whose ith coordinate is the value (either +1 or \u22121) of the ith variable appearing in \u03a6. Finally, we constrain that the sum of the elements of \u03a6 is exactly (k \u2212 2). This forces exactly one of the coordinates of the vector to be \u22121, so the variables must be set to a satisfying assignment.  It is not obvious how we are able to force such specific structure on the rotations in the variable gadget even when the ambient dimension gets as high as 4k \u2212 1. By constraining dot products of sums of basis vectors in the variable gadget we are able to resolve this problem. The full details and proof of Theorem 16 are located in the"}
