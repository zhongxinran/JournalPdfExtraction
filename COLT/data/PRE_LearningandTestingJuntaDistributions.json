On the other hand, the parity of the first k bits of x and y is not the same, because (cid:96) \u2208 [k]. Thus, one of them has probability zero. Note that we can pair up all the elements in Xi as we did for to x and y. Therefore, at least half of the elements in Xi have probability zero. By definition, we know ai = (cid:80) D(cid:48)(x) for i = 0, 1, . . . , 2k \u2212 1 and D(cid:48)(x) = ai/2k2 for x \u2208 Xi. We can conclude that D(cid:48) is 1/4-far from D, since  x\u2208Xi  dTV(D, D(cid:48)) =  |D(x) \u2212 D(cid:48)(x)| =  |D(x) \u2212 D(cid:48)(x)|  (cid:88)  x  1 2  1 2  =  2k\u22121 (cid:88)  (cid:88)  i=0  x\u2208Xi  1 2  2k\u22121 (cid:88)  (cid:88)  i=0  x\u2208Xi  2k\u22121 (cid:88)  1 2  |D(x) \u2212 ai/2k2| \u2265  (cid:88)  ai/2k2 \u2265  i=0  x\u2208Xi:D(x)=0  2k\u22121 (cid:88)  i=0  ai 4  \u2265  1 4  where the first inequality follows from the fact that at least 2k2\u22121 elements in Xi have probability zero. Since D(cid:48) is an arbitrary k-junta distribution on an arbitrary set J (cid:54)= [k], it follows that D is 1/4-far from being a junta distribution on any J (cid:54)= [k].  As we mentioned earlier, this implies that D is a k-junta distribution i\ufb00 C is a collection of uniform distributions. It is not hard to see that we can convert a sample drawn from C to get a sample from D. Thus, any (cid:15)-tester for a k-junta distribution can be used as an (cid:15)-tester for a collection of uniform distributions. Diakonikolas and Kane (2016) (in section M N /(cid:15)2) = \u2126(2(k1+k2)/2) samples are required to distinguish a 3.1.1) have shown that \u2126( collection of M uniform distributions from a collection which is (cid:15)-far from being uniform with probability 2/3. This implies that we need \u2126(2n/2/(cid:15)2) samples to test k-junta distri- butions.  \u221a  5.
