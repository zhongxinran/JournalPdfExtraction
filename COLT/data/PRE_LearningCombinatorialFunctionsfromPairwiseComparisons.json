Another open question is determining whether the sample complex- ity for the additive error results in Section 4 can be improved. We note, both of these questions are unresolved even in the setting where the sample consists of function values and the goal is to learn an approximate function. Another interesting question is to find nontrivial generalizations of the pairwise comparison model and show corresponding results. For instance, the distribution is over k-tuples and the top k(cid:48) sets in the tuple are ranked.
