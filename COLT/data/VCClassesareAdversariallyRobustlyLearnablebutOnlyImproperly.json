{"1": "We study the question of learning an adversarially robust predictor. We show that any hypothesis class $\\mathcal{H}$ with finite VC dimension is robustly PAC learnable with an \\emph{improper} learning rule. The requirement of being improper is necessary as we exhibit examples of hypothesis classes $\\mathcal{H}$ with finite VC dimension that are \\emph{not} robustly PAC learnable with any \\emph{proper} learning rule."}
