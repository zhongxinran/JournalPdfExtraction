{"1": "Many applications, including rank aggregation and crowd-labeling, can be modeled in terms of a bivariate isotonic matrix with unknown permutations acting on its rows and columns.  We consider the problem of estimating such a matrix based on noisy observations of a subset of its entries, and design and analyze a polynomial-time algorithm that improves upon the state of the art. In particular, our results imply that any such $n \\times n$ matrix can be estimated efficiently in the normalized Frobenius norm at rate $\\widetilde{\\mathcal O}(n^{-3/4})$, thus narrowing the gap between $\\widetilde{\\mathcal O}(n^{-1})$ and $\\widetilde{\\mathcal O}(n^{-1/2})$, which were hitherto the rates of the most statistically and computationally efficient methods, respectively."}
