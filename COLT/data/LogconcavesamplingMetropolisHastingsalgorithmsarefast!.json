{"1": "We consider the problem of sampling from a strongly log-concave density in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, and prove a non-asymptotic upper bound on the mixing time of the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA). The method draws samples by running a Markov chain obtained from the discretization of an appropriate Langevin diffusion, combined with an accept-reject step to ensure the correct stationary distribution. Relative to known guarantees for the unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA), our bounds reveal that the use of an accept-reject step in MALA leads to an exponentially improved dependence on the error-tolerance. Concretely, in order to obtain samples with TV error at most $\\delta$ for a density with condition number $\\kappa$, we show that MALA requires $\\mathcal{O} \\big(\\kappa d \\log(1/\\delta) \\big)$ steps, as compared to the $\\mathcal{O} \\big(\\kappa^2 d/\\delta^2 \\big)$ steps established in past work on ULA.  We also demonstrate the gains of MALA over ULA for weakly log-concave densities.  Furthermore, we derive mixing time bounds for a zeroth-order method Metropolized random walk (MRW) and show that it mixes $\\mathcal{O}(\\kappa d)$ slower than MALA."}
