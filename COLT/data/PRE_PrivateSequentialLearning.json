Our results thus demonstrate that the price of privacy is at most an additive factor of 2L.  The proof of Theorem 4 is given in Tsitsiklis et al. (2018). For the upper bound, we con- struct a certain Opportunistic Bisection (OB) query strategy, where the learner augments a bisection search with 2L additional \u201copportunistic\u201d queries in a randomized and symmetric manner, such the adversary cannot be certain whether the true value is discovered by the bisection search, or the opportunistic queries. For the lower bound, one may ask whether the additional 2L queries need to be distinct from the log(1/(cid:15)) queries used by the bisection search, or essentially, whether the query complexity could be further reduced by \u201cblending\u201d the queries for obfuscation with those for identifying the true value in a more effective manner. However, we show that such \u201cblending\u201d is not possible.  References  Benny Chor, Eyal Kushilevitz, Oded Goldreich, and Madhu Sudan. Private information retrieval.
