{"1": "In this work we provide an estimator for the covariance matrix of a heavy-tailed multivariate distribution. We prove that the proposed estimator $\\widehat{\\mathbf{S}}$ admits an \\textit{affine-invariant} bound of the form \\[ (1-\\varepsilon) \\mathbf{S} \\preccurlyeq \\widehat{\\mathbf{S}} \\preccurlyeq (1+\\varepsilon) \\mathbf{S} \\]{in} high probability, where $\\mathbf{S}$ is the unknown covariance matrix, and $\\preccurlyeq$ is the positive semidefinite order on symmetric matrices. The result only requires the existence of fourth-order moments, and allows for $\\varepsilon = O(\\sqrt{\\kappa^4 d\\log(d/\\delta)/n})$ where $\\kappa^4$ is a measure of kurtosis of the distribution, $d$ is the dimensionality of the space, $n$ is the sample size, and $1-\\delta$ is the desired confidence level. More generally, we can allow for regularization with level $\\lambda$, then $d$ gets replaced with the degrees of freedom number. Denoting $\\text{cond}(\\mathbf{S})$ the condition number of $\\mathbf{S}$, the computational cost of the novel estimator is $O(d^2 n + d^3\\log(\\text{cond}(\\mathbf{S})))$, which is comparable to the cost of the sample covariance estimator in the statistically interesing regime $n \\ge d$. We consider applications of our estimator to eigenvalue estimation with relative error, and to ridge regression with heavy-tailed random design."}
