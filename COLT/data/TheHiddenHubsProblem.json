{"1": "We introduce the following \\em hidden hubs model $H(n,k,\\sigma_0, \\sigma_1)$: the input is an $n \\times n$ random matrix $A$ with a subset $S$ of $k$ special rows (hubs); entries in rows outside $S$ are generated from the Gaussian distribution $p_0 = N(0,\\sigma_0^2)$, while for each row in $S$, an unknown subset of $k$ of its entries are generated from $p_1 = N(0,\\sigma_1^2)$, $\\sigma_1>\\sigma_0$, and the rest of the entries from $p_0$. The special rows with higher variance entries can be viewed as hidden higher-degree hubs. The problem we address is to identify the hubs efficiently. The planted Gaussian Submatrix Model is the special case where the higher variance entries must all lie in a $k \\times k$ submatrix. If $k\u2265c\\sqrt{n}\\ln n$, just the row sums are sufficient to find $S$ in the general model. For the Gaussian submatrix problem (and the related planted clique problem), this can be improved by a $\\sqrt\\ln n$ factor to $k \\ge c\\sqrt{n}$ by spectral or combinatorial methods. We give a polynomial-time algorithm to identify all the hidden hubs with high probability for $k \\ge n^0.5-\u03b4$ for some $\u03b4>0$, when $\\sigma_1^2>2\\sigma_0^2$.  The algorithm extends to the setting where planted entries might have different variances, each at least $\\sigma_1^2$. We also show a nearly matching lower bound: for $\\sigma_1^2 \\le 2\\sigma_0^2$, there is no polynomial-time Statistical Query algorithm for distinguishing between a matrix whose entries are all from $N(0,\\sigma_0^2)$ and a matrix with $k=n^0.5-\u03b4$ hidden hubs for any $\u03b4>0$. The lower bound as well as the algorithm are related to whether the chi-squared distance of the two distributions diverges. At the critical value $\\sigma_1^2=2\\sigma_0^2$, we show that the hidden hubs problem can be solved for $k\u2265c\\sqrt n(\\ln n)^1/4$, improving on the naive row sum-based method."}
