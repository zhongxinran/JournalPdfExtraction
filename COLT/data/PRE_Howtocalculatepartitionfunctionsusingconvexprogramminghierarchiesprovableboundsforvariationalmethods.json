Generally, unless there is some special structure, Markov Chain methods will provide no non-trivial guarantee in this regime - however, we get an order \u03f5n additive factor approximation to log Z, which translates to a (1 + \u03f5)n factor approximation of Z. We do not, to the best of our knowledge, know how to get such results using any other methods.  (cid:15) \u201cLow temperature regime\u201d, i.e. when jJj = !(1=d). In this case, in light of the variational characterization of log Z and the fact that the entropy is upper bounded by n, the dominating (i;j)2E(G) Ji;jE(cid:22)[xixj], so essentially the quality of term will typically be the energy term approximation will be dictated by the hardness of the optimization problem corresponding to the energy term. (e.g., for the anti-ferromagnetic case, where all the potentials Ji;j are negative, the optimization problem corresponding to the energy term is just max-cut, and we cannot hope for more than a constant factor approximation to log Z for general (negative) potentials.)  \u2211  6. Conclusion  We presented simple new algorithms for calculating partition functions in Ising models based on variational methods and convex programming hierarchies. To the best of our knowledge, these techniques give new, non-trivial approximation guarantees for the partition function when correla- tion decay does not hold, and are the first provable, convex variational methods. Our guarantees are for dense or low threshold rank graphs, and in the process we design novel entropy approximations based on the low-order moments of a distribution.  We barely scratched the surface, and we leave many interesting directions open. Our methods are very generic, and are probably applicable to many other classes of partition functions apart from Ising models. One natural candidate is weighted matchings due to the connections to calculating non-negative permanents.  Another intriguing question is to determine if there is a similar approach that can subsume prior results on partition function calculation in the regime of correlation decay, as our guarantees are much weaker there. This would give a convex relaxation interpretation of these types of results.  References  Sanjeev Arora and Rong Ge. New tools for graph coloring.
