{"1": "Known algorithms applied to online logistic regression on a feasible set of \\emphL_2 diameter \\emphD achieve regret bounds like \\emphO(\\emphe^D log \\emphT) in one dimension, but we show a bound of \\emphO(\u221a\\emphD  + log \\emphT) is possible in a binary 1-dimensional problem. Thus, we pose the following question: Is it possible to achieve a regret bound for online logistic regression that is \\emphO(poly(\\emphD) log(\\emphT))? Even if this is not possible in general, it would be interesting to have a bound that reduces to our bound in the one-dimensional case."}
