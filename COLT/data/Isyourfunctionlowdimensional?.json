{"1": "We study the problem of testing if a function depends on a small number of linear directions of its input data. We call a function $f$  a \\emph{linear $k$-junta} if it is completely determined by some $k$-dimensional subspace of the input space. In this paper, we study the problem of testing whether a given $n$ variable function $f : \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}$, is a linear $k$-junta or $\\epsilon$-far from all linear $k$-juntas, where the closeness is measured with respect to the Gaussian measure on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Linear $k$-juntas are a common generalization of two fundamental classes from Boolean function analysis (both of which have been studied in property testing) \\textbf{1.} $k$- juntas which are functions on the Boolean cube which depend on at most k of the variables and \\textbf{2.}  intersection of $k$ halfspaces, a fundamental geometric concept class.   We show that the class of linear $k$-juntas is not testable, but adding a surface area constraint makes it testable: we give a $\\mathsf{poly}(k \\cdot s/\\epsilon)$-query non-adaptive tester for linear $k$-juntas with surface area at most $s$. We show that the polynomial dependence on $s$ is necessary. Moreover, we show that if the function is a linear $k$-junta with surface area at most $s$,  we give a $(s \\cdot k)^{O(k)}$-query non-adaptive algorithm to learn the function \\emph{up to a rotation of the basis}.  In particular, this implies that we can test the class of intersections of $k$ halfspaces in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with query complexity independent of $n$."}
