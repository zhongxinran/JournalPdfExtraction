{"1": "What is the mechanism of learning in the brain?  Despite breathtaking advances in neuroscience,  and in machine learning, we do not seem close to an answer.  Using Valiant\u2019s neuronal model as a foundation, we introduce PJOIN (for \u201cpredictive join\"), a primitive that combines association and prediction. We show that PJOIN can be implemented naturally in Valiant\u2019s conservative, formal model of cortical computation. Using PJOIN \u2014 and almost nothing else \u2014 we give a simple algorithm for unsupervised learning of arbitrary ensembles of binary patterns (solving an open problem in Valiant\u2019s work). This algorithm relies crucially on prediction, and entails significant downward traffic (\u201cfeedback\") while parsing stimuli. Prediction and feedback are well-known features of neural cognition and, as far as we know, this is the first theoretical prediction of their essential role in learning."}
