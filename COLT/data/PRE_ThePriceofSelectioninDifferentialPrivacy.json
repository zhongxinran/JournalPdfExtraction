Since P [xa = \u22121] = (1 \u2212 E[xa])/2, we get that, P (cid:2)xa = \u22121 (cid:12) this back into (4), we get that the variables are positively correlated. (cid:105)  We have that, E  (cid:104)(cid:80)  i\u2208R,j\u2208v xij  = |R|k\u03bb, and since Hoeffding\u2019s inequality applies equally well  (cid:12) B(cid:3) \u2264 P [xa = \u22121]. Substituting  to positively-correlated random variables Panconesi and Srinivasan (1997), we also have,  P (cid:101)XS  (cid:88)  i\u2208R,j\u2208v  xij \u2264 |R|\u03c4c  \uf8f9  \uf8fb  \uf8ee  \uf8f0  \uf8ee  \uf8f0  \u2264 P (cid:101)XS  (cid:88)  i\u2208R,j\u2208V \uf8eb  (cid:16)  \u2264 exp  \uf8ec \uf8ed\u2212  |R|(cid:112)2k ln(1/\u03c1)  (cid:17)2  2|R|k  \uf8f6 \uf8f8 = \u03c1|R|. \uf8f7  \uf8f9 xij < |R|k\u03bb \u2212 |R|(cid:112)2k ln(1/\u03c1) \uf8fb  Substituting this in equation 2, we get that, P (cid:101)XS  (cid:86) i\u2208R our definition of the distributions, XS, (cid:101)XS, we have, P XS  Ei  \u2264 \u03c1|R|.
