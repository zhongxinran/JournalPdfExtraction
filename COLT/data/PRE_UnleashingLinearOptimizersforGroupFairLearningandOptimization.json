Conclusions  This paper enables application designers and data scientists to optimize complex continuous ob- jectives, with possibly many local non-global minima, that account for differences across various groups. It is not our claim or belief that important issues such as fairness can be captured solely by such group statistics. However, with this ability, domain experts are hopefully better equipped to design objectives that, when optimized, lead to desirable outcomes.  Acknowledgments.
