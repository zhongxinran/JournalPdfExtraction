{"1": "We provide sharp empirical estimates of expectation, variance and normal approximation for a class of statistics whose variation in any argument does not change too much when another argument is modified. Examples of such weak interactions are furnished by U- and V-statistics, Lipschitz L-statistics and various error functionals of $\\ell_2$-regularized algorithms and Gibbs algorithms."}
