{"1": "Modeling community formation and detecting hidden communities in networks is a well studied problem. However, theoretical analysis of  community detection has been mostly limited to models with non-overlapping communities such as the stochastic block model. In this paper, we remove this restriction, and consider a family of probabilistic network models with overlapping communities, termed as the mixed membership Dirichlet model, first introduced   in Aioroldi et. al (2008). This model allows for nodes to have fractional memberships in multiple communities and assumes that the community memberships are drawn from a Dirichlet distribution. We propose a unified  approach to learning these models via a   tensor spectral decomposition method. Our estimator is based on  low-order  moment tensor of the observed network, consisting of  3-star counts. Our learning method is fast and is based on   simple linear algebra operations, e.g. singular value decomposition and tensor power iterations. We provide guaranteed recovery of community memberships and model parameters and present a careful finite sample analysis of our learning method. Additionally, our results  match the best known scaling requirements in the special case of the stochastic block model."}
