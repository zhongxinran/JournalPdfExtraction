In the PVW case there are now two global indices, one for the top of the outer hourglasses and one for the bottom of the outer hourglasses. This gives us a global factor of r 2 rather than r.  2. Since one of the outer indices is now merged with the corresponding inner index, instead of the (cid:17) 2q for the inner indices, we will only by a factor of at most  UVW terms giving us factors of (cid:16) \u00b5 have two of these factors. This increases our bound on E (cid:16) nma x \u00b5  (cid:2) tr((YY T )q)  (cid:17) 2q, and (cid:16) \u00b5  (cid:17) 2q, (cid:16) \u00b5  (cid:17) 2q  n1  n2  n3  (cid:3)  Putting these di\ufb00erences together, our bound will now be (cid:16) \u02dcO( n1n2n3nma x B (cid:2) tr((Y4Y T less than the bound we had for E  m\u00b5  (cid:3) 4 )q)  .  )(cid:17) 2q  r 2 which is still much  References  Boaz Barak and Ankur Moitra.
