    "abstract": "Planning plays an important role in the broad class of decision theory. Planning has drawn much attention in recent work in the robotics and sequential decision making areas. Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL), as an agent-environment interaction problem, has brought further attention to planning methods. Generally in RL, one can assume a generative model, e.g. graphical models, for the environment, and then the task for the RL agent is to learn the model parameters and find the optimal strategy based on these learnt parameters. Based on environment behavior, the agent can assume various types of generative models, e.g. Multi Armed Bandit for a static environment, or Markov Decision Process (MDP) for a dynamic environment. The advantage of these popular models is their simplicity, which results in tractable methods of learning the parameters and finding the optimal policy. The drawback of these models is again their simplicity: these models usually underfit and underestimate the actual environment behavior. For example, in robotics, the agent usually has noisy observations of the environment inner state and MDP is not a suitable model. More complex models like Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) can compensate for this drawback. Fitting this model to the environment, where the partial observation is given to the agent, generally gives dramatic performance improvement, sometimes unbounded improvement, compared to MDP. In general, finding the optimal policy for the POMDP model is computationally intractable and fully non convex, even for the class of memoryless policies. The open problem is to come up with a method to find an exact or an approximate optimal stochastic memoryless policy for POMDP models.",

    "abstract": "The best arm identification problem (BEST-1-ARM) is the most basic pure exploration problem in stochastic multi-armed bandits. The problem has a long history and attracted significant attention for the last decade. However, we do not yet have a complete understanding of the optimal sample complexity of the problem: The state-of-the-art algorithms achieve a sample complexity of O(\\sum_i=2^n \\Delta_i^-2(\\lnδ^-1 + \\ln\\ln\\Delta_i^-1)) (\\Delta_i is the difference between the largest mean and the i^th mean), while the best known lower bound is Ω(\\sum_i=2^n \\Delta_i^-2\\lnδ^-1) for general instances and Ω(∆^-2 \\ln\\ln ∆^-1) for the two-arm instances. We propose to study the instance-wise optimality for the BEST-1-ARM problem. Previous work has proved that it is impossible to have an instance optimal algorithm for the 2-arm problem. However, we conjecture that modulo the additive term Ω(\\Delta_2^-2 \\ln\\ln \\Delta_2^-1) (which is an upper bound and worst case lower bound for the 2-arm problem), there is an instance optimal algorithm for BEST-1-ARM. Moreover, we introduce a new quantity, called the gap entropy for a best-arm problem instance, and conjecture that it is the instance-wise lower bound. Hence, resolving this conjecture would provide a final answer to the old and basic problem.",

We have recently shown that geodesic exponential kernels are only positive definite for all bandwidths when the input space has strong linear properties. This negative result hints that radial kernel are perhaps not suitable over geodesic metric spaces after all. Here, however, we present evidence that large intervals of bandwidths exist where geodesic exponential kernels have high probability of being positive definite over finite datasets, while still having significant predictive power. From this we formulate conjectures on the probability of a positive definite kernel matrix for a finite random sample, depending on the geometry of the data space and the spread of the sample.",

For d >2, similar but slightly less accurate statements hold. Our lower bounds improve over previous ones by Ben-David et al. and can be interpreted as exhibiting a weakness of kernel-based classifiers. Our upper bounds, on the other hand, can be interpreted as exhibiting the universality of kernel-based classifiers. The lower bounds are obtained by probabilistic constructions, using a theorem of Warren in real algebraic topology. The upper bounds are obtained using a result of Welzl about spanning trees with low stabbing number, and using the moment curve. The upper bound technique is also used to: (i) provide estimates on the number of classes of a given VC dimension, and the number of maximum classes of a given VC dimension – answering a question of Frankl from ’89, and (ii) design an efficient algorithm that provides an O(N/\\log(N)) multiplicative approximation for the sign rank (computing the sign rank is equivalent to the existential theory of the reals). We also observe a general connection between sign rank and spectral gaps which is based on Forster’s argument. Consider the N \\times N adjacency matrix of a ∆regular graph with a second eigenvalue of absolute value λand ∆≤N/2. We show that the sign rank of the signed version of this matrix is at least ∆/λ. We use this connection to prove the existence of a maximum class C⊆{\\pm 1}^N with VC dimension 2 and sign rank \\tildeΘ(N^1/2). This answers a question of Ben-David et al. regarding the sign rank of large VC classes. We also describe limitations of this approach, in the spirit of the Alon-Boppana theorem.

For the first time in the literature, we derive performance bounds for model-based techniques where the model inaccuracy is measured in weighted norms. Moreover, our bounds show a decreased sensitivity to the discount factor and, unlike similar bounds derived for other approaches, they are insensitive to measure mismatch. Similarly to previous works, our proofs are also based on contraction arguments, but with the main differences that we use carefully constructed norms building on Banach lattices, and the contraction property is only assumed for operators acting on “compressed” spaces, thus weakening previous assumptions, while strengthening previous results.",

    "abstract": "We study the \\emphapproximate recovery problem: Given corrupted 1-bit measurements of the form sign(w^* ⋅x_i), recover a vector w that is a good approximation to w^* ∈\\Re^d. This problem has been studied by both the learning theory and signal processing communities. In learning theory, this is known as the problem of \\emphlearning halfspaces with noise, and in signal processing, as \\emph1-bit compressed sensing, in which there is an additional assumption that w^* is t-sparse. The challenge in both cases is to design computationally efficient algorithms that are tolerant to large amounts of noise under realistic noise models. Furthermore, in the case of 1-bit compressed sensing, we require  the number of measurements x_i to scale polynomially in t and only polylogarithmically in d, the ambient dimension. In this work, we introduce algorithms with nearly optimal guarantees for both problems under two realistic noise models, \\emphbounded (Massart) noise and \\emphadversarial (agnostic) noise, when the measurements x_i’s are drawn from any isotropic log-concave distribution. In bounded (Massart) noise, an adversary can flip the measurement of each point x with probability η(x)≤η< 1/2. For this problem, we present an efficient algorithm that returns w such that \\|w- w^*\\|_2 ≤εin time poly(d, \\frac 1 ε) for \\emphany constant η< 1/2.  This improves significantly over the best known result of Awasthi et al. 2015, in this space that required the noise to be as small as η≈10^-6.

Our results improve on the best known approximation results in this space and under some regimes improve on the sample complexity of the existing results.

For instance, it is notoriously hard for consumers to reliably assign values to bundles of merchandise. Instead, it might be much easier for a consumer to report which of two bundles she likes better. With this motivation in mind, we consider an alternative learning model, wherein the algorithm must learn the underlying function up to pairwise comparisons, from pairwise comparisons. In this model, we present a series of novel algorithms that learn over a wide variety of combinatorial function classes.

Above this threshold, we show that any partition of the nodes into q groups which is as ‘good’ as the planted one, in terms of the number of within- and between-group edges, is correlated with it.

This is also the first algorithm for tensor completion that works in the overcomplete case when r > n, and in fact it works all the way up to r = n^3/2-ε. Our proofs are short and simple and are based on establishing a new connection between noisy tensor completion (through the language of Rademacher complexity) and the task of refuting random constant satisfaction problems. This connection seems to have gone unnoticed even in the context of matrix completion. Furthermore, we use this connection to show matching lower bounds. Our main technical result is in characterizing the Rademacher complexity of the sequence of norms that arise in the sum-of-squares relaxations to the tensor nuclear norm.

These include  symmetric matrix eigendecomposition, certain tensor decompositions, Independent Component Analysis (ICA), spectral clustering and Gaussian mixture learning. Each of these problems reduces to an instance of our general model, which we call a “Basis Encoding Function\" (BEF). We show that learning a basis within this model can then be provably and efficiently achieved using a first order  iteration algorithm (gradient iteration). Our algorithm goes beyond tensor methods while generalizing a number of existing algorithms—e.g., the power method for symmetric matrices, the tensor power iteration for orthogonal decomposable tensors, and cumulant-based FastICA—all within a broader function-based dynamical systems framework. Our framework also unifies the unusual phenomenon observed in these domains that they can be solved using efficient non-convex optimization. Specifically, we describe a class of BEFs such that their local maxima on the unit sphere are in one-to-one correspondence with the basis elements. This description relies on a certain “hidden convexity\" property of these functions. We provide a complete theoretical analysis of the gradient iteration even when the BEF is perturbed. We show convergence and complexity bounds polynomial in dimension and other relevant parameters, such as perturbation size. Our perturbation results can be considered as a  non-linear version of the classical Davis-Kahan theorem for perturbations of eigenvectors of symmetric matrices. In addition we show that   our algorithm exhibits fast (superlinear) convergence and relate the speed of convergence to the properties of the BEF. Moreover, the gradient iteration algorithm can be easily and efficiently implemented in practice.",

The collection is a subset of the 2^p possible supports and both its cardinality and its elements can depend on the data. The procedures satisfy oracle inequalities with no assumption on the design matrix. Then we use these procedures to aggregate the supports that appear on the regularization path of the Lasso in order to construct an estimator that mimics the best Lasso estimator. If the restricted eigenvalue condition on the design matrix is satisfied, then this estimator achieves optimal prediction bounds. Finally, we discuss the computational cost of these procedures.",

Many reputation systems are vulnerable to manipulation, and protected only by keeping algorithms secret, avoiding high-stakes applications, or using side information to identify malicious users.  The current situation is reminiscent of pre-modern cryptography, characterized by a patchwork of ad hoc techniques with minimal formal understanding of their security. We propose a reputation system which provably achieves a very strong correctness guarantee under extremely pessimistic assumptions—it works even given a supermajority of malicious users, converges to optimal behavior after a constant number of interactions per user, does not require repeated interactions, and accommodates time-varying quality of resources. Our formal model is simple but general.  In each period, a user is given an opportunity to interact with a resource, and must accept or reject the proposed interaction.  If they accept, they receive a payoff in [-1, 1].  Ideally all users would behave honestly, pooling their data and quickly learning which resources are worth interacting with.  Our protocol essentially matches this performance when all users are honest, while guaranteeing that adding malicious users or users with varying tastes does very little damage. We also extend our results to a more challenging setting where users interact with each other rather than with static resources, and where the two parties to an interaction may receive different payoffs.",

Despite the vast empirical evidence supporting this belief, theoretical justifications to date are limited. In particular, they do not account for the locality, sharing and pooling constructs of convolutional networks, the most successful deep learning architecture to date. In this work we derive a deep network architecture based on arithmetic circuits that inherently employs locality, sharing and pooling. An equivalence between the networks and hierarchical tensor factorizations is established. We show that a shallow network corresponds to CP (rank-1) decomposition, whereas a deep network corresponds to Hierarchical Tucker decomposition. Using tools from measure theory and matrix algebra, we prove that besides a negligible set, all functions that can be implemented by a deep network of polynomial size, require exponential size in order to be realized (or even approximated) by a shallow network. Since log-space computation transforms our networks into SimNets, the result applies directly to a deep learning architecture demonstrating promising empirical performance.

In this paper, we study three notions of generalization—increasing in strength—that are \\emphrobust to postprocessing and amenable to adaptive composition, and examine the relationships between them.  We call the weakest such notion \\emphRobust Generalization. A second, intermediate, notion is the stability guarantee known as \\emphdifferential privacy.

We prove that every hypothesis class that is PAC learnable is also PAC learnable in a robustly generalizing fashion, with almost the same sample complexity. It was previously known that differentially private algorithms satisfy robust generalization. In this paper, we show that robust generalization is a strictly weaker concept, and that there is a learning task that can be carried out subject to robust generalization guarantees, yet cannot be carried out subject to differential privacy. We also show that perfect generalization is a strictly stronger guarantee than differential privacy, but that, nevertheless, many learning tasks can be carried out subject to the guarantees of perfect generalization.",

For k ∈\\mathbbZ_+, a \\emk-SIIRV of order n ∈\\mathbbZ_+ is the probability distribution of the sum of n mutually independent random variables each supported on {0, 1, …, k-1}. We denote by \\cal S_n,k the set of all k-SIIRVs of order n. How many samples are required to learn an arbitrary distribution in \\cal S_n,k? In this paper, we tightly characterize the sample and computational complexity of this problem. More precisely, we design a computationally efficient algorithm that uses \\widetildeO(k/ε^2) samples, and learns an arbitrary k-SIIRV within error ε, in total variation distance. Moreover, we show that the \\em optimal sample complexity of this learning problem is Θ((k/ε^2)\\sqrt\\log(1/ε)), i.e., we prove an upper bound and a matching information-theoretic lower bound. Our algorithm proceeds by learning the Fourier transform of the target k-SIIRV in its effective support. Its correctness relies on the \\em approximate sparsity of the Fourier transform of k-SIIRVs – a structural property that we establish, roughly stating that the Fourier transform of k-SIIRVs has small magnitude outside a small set. Along the way we prove several new structural results about k-SIIRVs. As one of our main structural contributions, we give an efficient algorithm to construct a sparse \\em proper ε-cover for \\cal S_n,k, in total variation distance. We also obtain a novel geometric characterization of the space of k-SIIRVs. Our characterization allows us to prove a tight lower bound on the size of ε-covers for \\cal S_n,k – establishing that our cover upper bound is optimal – and is the key ingredient in our tight sample complexity lower bound. Our approach of exploiting the sparsity of the Fourier transform in distribution learning is general, and has recently found additional applications. In a subsequent work, we use a generalization of this idea to obtain the first computationally efficient learning algorithm for Poisson multinomial distributions. In a separate work, we build on our Fourier-based approach to obtain the fastest known proper learning algorithm for Poisson binomial distributions (2-SIIRVs).",

Given \\widetildeO(1/ε^2) samples from an unknown PBD P, our algorithm runs in time (1/\\eps)^O(\\log \\log (1/ε)), and outputs a hypothesis PBD that is ε-close to P in total variation distance. The sample complexity of our algorithm is known to be nearly-optimal, up to logarithmic factors, as established in previous work. However, the previously best known running time for properly learning PBDs was (1/ε)^O(\\log(1/ε)), and was essentially obtained by enumeration over an appropriate  ε-cover.

As one of our main contributions, we provide a novel structural characterization of PBDs, showing that any PBD P is ε-close to another PBD Q with O(\\log(1/ε)) distinct parameters.

Our proof combines tools from Fourier analysis and algebraic geometry. Our approach to the proper learning problem is as follows: Starting with an accurate non-proper hypothesis, we fit a PBD to this hypothesis.

Our aforementioned structural characterization allows us to reduce the corresponding fitting problem to a collection of (1/ε)^O(\\log \\log(1/ε)) systems of low-degree polynomial inequalities.

We present a theoretical study of \\ell_p-based Laplacian regularization under a d-dimensional geometric random graph model. We provide a variational characterization of the performance of this regularized learner as N grows to infinity while n stays constant; the associated optimality conditions lead to a partial differential equation that must be satisfied by the associated function estimate \\widehatf.  From this formulation we derive several predictions on the limiting behavior the function \\fhat, including (a) a phase transition in its smoothness at the threshold p = d + 1; and (b) a tradeoff between smoothness and sensitivity to the underlying unlabeled data distribution P.  Thus, over the range p ≤d, the function estimate \\widehatf is degenerate and “spiky,” whereas for p≥d+1, the function estimate \\fhat is smooth.  We show that the effect of the underlying density vanishes monotonically with p, such that in the limit p = ∞, corresponding to the so-called Absolutely Minimal Lipschitz Extension, the estimate \\widehatf is independent of the distribution P. Under the assumption of semi-supervised smoothness, ignoring P can lead to poor statistical performance; in particular, we construct a specific example for d=1 to demonstrate that p=2 has lower risk than p=∞due to the former penalty adapting to P and the latter ignoring it.  We also provide simulations that verify the accuracy of our predictions for finite sample sizes.  Together, these properties show that p = d+1 is an optimal choice, yielding a function estimate \\fhat that is both smooth and non-degenerate, while remaining maximally sensitive to P.",

Given A_1, \\ldots, A_n∈\\mathbbR^d\\times d sampled independently from distributions satisfying \\mathbbE[A_i] = Σfor Σ\\succeq 0, we present an O(d)-space linear-time single-pass streaming algorithm for estimating the top eigenvector of Σ. The algorithm nearly matches (and in certain cases improves upon) the accuracy obtained by the standard batch method that computes top eigenvector of the empirical covariance \\frac1n \\sum_i ∈[n] A_i as analyzed by the matrix Bernstein inequality. Moreover, to achieve constant accuracy, our algorithm improves upon the best previous known sample complexities of streaming algorithms by either a multiplicative factor of O(d) or 1/\\mathrmgap where \\mathrmgap is the relative distance between the top two eigenvalues of Σ. We achieve these results through a novel analysis of the classic Oja’s algorithm, one of the oldest and perhaps, most popular algorithms for streaming PCA. We show that simply picking a random initial point w_0 and applying the natural update rule w_i + 1 = w_i + \\eta_i A_i w_i suffices for suitable choice of \\eta_i.

Many algorithms exist for learning communities in the Stochastic Block Model, but they do not work well in the presence of errors. In this paper, we initiate the study of robust algorithms for partial recovery in SBM with modeling errors or noise. We consider graphs generated according to the Stochastic Block Model and then modified by an adversary. We allow two types of adversarial errors, Feige—Kilian or monotone errors, and edge outlier errors. Mossel, Neeman and Sly (STOC 2015) posed an open question about whether an almost exact recovery is possible when the adversary is allowed to add o(n) edges. Our work answers this question affirmatively even in the case of k>2 communities. We then show that our algorithms work not only when the instances come from SBM, but also work when the instances come from any distribution of graphs that is \\varepsilon m close to SBM in the Kullback—Leibler divergence. This result also works in the presence of adversarial errors. Finally, we present almost tight lower bounds for two communities.",

An inspection by an expert produces a noisy outcome that depends both on the job’s hidden label and the type of the expert, and occupies the expert for a finite time duration. A decision maker’s task is to dynamically assign inspections so that the resulting outcomes can be used to accurately recover the labels of all jobs, while keeping the system stable. Among our chief motivations are applications in crowd-sourcing, diagnostics, and experiment designs, where one wishes to efficiently discover the nature of a large number of items, using a finite pool of computational resources or human agents. We focus on the \\emphcapacity of such an information processing system. Given a level of accuracy guarantee, we ask how many experts are needed in order to stabilize the system, and through what inspection architecture. Our main result provides an adaptive inspection policy that is asymptotically optimal in the following sense: the ratio between the required number of experts under our policy and the theoretical optimal converges to one, as the probability of error in label recovery tends to zero.",

Suppose that as n \\to ∞, a= b+ μ\\sqrt b ,  c=b+  ν\\sqrt b  for two fixed constants μ, ν, and b \\to ∞with b=n^o(1).

We study the rate of convergence, finding that while linear convergence to the correct function can be achieved for any threshold using a fixed set of primitives, for quadratic convergence, the size of the primitives must grow as the threshold approaches 0 or 1. We also study finite realizations of this process and the learnability of the functions realized. We show that the constructions realized are accurate outside a small interval near the target threshold, where the size of the construction grows as the inverse square of the interval width. This phenomenon, that errors are higher closer to thresholds (and thresholds closer to the boundary are harder to represent), is a well-known cognitive finding.",

Recent work has established this is possible under the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) and noisy permutation (NP) models. Here we introduce a broad family of ‘low-rank’ conditions on the probabilities P_ij under which the resulting preference matrix P has low rank under some link function, and show these conditions encompass the BTL and Thurstone classes as special cases, but are considerably more general. We then give a new algorithm called low-rank pairwise ranking (LRPR) which provably learns a good ranking from comparisons of only O(n\\log(n)) randomly chosen comparisons under such low-rank models. Our algorithm and analysis make use of tools from the theory of low-rank matrix completion, and provide a new perspective on the problem of ranking from pairwise comparisons in non-active settings.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of approximating partition functions for Ising models. We make use of recent tools in combinatorial optimization: the Sherali-Adams and Lasserre convex programming hierarchies, in combination with variational methods to get algorithms for calculating partition functions in these families. These techniques give new, non-trivial approximation guarantees for the partition function beyond the regime of correlation decay. They also generalize some classical results from statistical physics about the Curie-Weiss ferromagnetic Ising model, as well as provide a partition function counterpart of classical results about max-cut on dense graphs (Arora, 1995). With this, we connect techniques from two apparently disparate research areas – optimization and counting/partition function approximations. (i.e. #-P type of problems). Furthermore, we design to the best of our knowledge the first provable, convex variational methods. Though in the literature there are a host of convex versions of variational methods, they come with no guarantees (apart from some extremely special cases, like e.g. the graph has a single cycle). We consider dense and low rank graphs, and interestingly, the reason our approach works on these types of graphs is because local correlations propagate to global correlations – completely the opposite of algorithms based on correlation decay. In the process we design novel entropy approximations based on the low-order moments of a distribution. Our proof techniques are very simple and generic, and likely to be applicable to many other settings other than Ising models.",

An experimenter sequentially chooses designs to measure and observes noisy signals of their quality with the goal of confidently identifying the best design  after a small number of measurements. I propose three simple Bayesian algorithms for adaptively allocating measurement effort. One is Top-Two Probability sampling, which computes the two designs with the highest posterior probability of being optimal, and then randomizes to select among these two. One is a variant a top-two sampling which considers not only the probability a design is optimal, but the expected amount by which its quality exceeds that of other designs. The final algorithm is a modified version of Thompson sampling that is tailored for identifying the best design. I prove that these simple algorithms satisfy a strong optimality property. In a frequestist setting where the true quality of the designs is fixed, one hopes the posterior definitively identifies the optimal design, in the sense that that the posterior probability assigned to the event that some other design is optimal converges to zero as measurements are collected. I show that under the proposed algorithms this convergence occurs at an \\emphexponential rate, and the corresponding exponent is the best possible among all allocation rules.",

We present distribution-dependent lower bounds based on a particular construction which force a learner to consider all N-choose-K subsets, and match naive extensions of known upper bounds in the bandit setting obtained by treating each subset as a separate arm. Nevertheless, we present evidence that exhaustive search may be avoided for certain, favorable distributions because the influence of high-order order correlations may be dominated by lower order statistics.
