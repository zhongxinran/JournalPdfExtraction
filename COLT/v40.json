    "abstract": "The restricted eigenvalue (RE) condition characterizes the sample complexity of accurate recovery in the context of high-dimensional estimators such as Lasso and Dantzig selector (Bickel et al., 2009). Recent work has shown that random design matrices drawn from any thin-tailed (sub-Gaussian) distributions satisfy the RE condition with high probability, when the number of samples scale as the square of the Gaussian width of the restricted set (Banerjee et al., 2014; Tropp, 2015). We pose the equivalent question for heavy-tailed distributions: Given a random design matrix drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution satisfying the smallball property (Mendelson, 2015), does the design matrix satisfy the RE condition with the same order of sample complexity as sub-Gaussian distributions? An answer to the question will guide the design of highdimensional estimators for heavy tailed problems.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has enjoyed a resurgence of interest in the last few years for such applications as image and speech recognition, or natural language processing. The vast majority of practical applications of deep learning focus on supervised learning, where the supervised loss function is minimized using stochastic gradient descent. The properties of this highly non-convex loss function, such as its landscape and the behavior of critical points (maxima, minima, and saddle points), as well as the reason why large- and small-size networks achieve radically different practical performance, are however very poorly understood. It was only recently shown that new results in spin-glass theory potentially may provide an explanation for these problems by establishing a connection between the loss function of the neural networks and the Hamiltonian of the spherical spin-glass models. The connection between both models relies on a number of possibly unrealistic assumptions, yet the empirical evidence suggests that the connection may exist in real. The question we pose is whether it is possible to drop some of these assumptions to establish a stronger connection between both models.",

This question is studied for \\ell_p/\\ell_q-settings, and their matrix analogues (Schatten norms), where we find surprising gaps on lower bounds compared to state of the art methods.

It is the first teaching complexity notion for which interesting relationships to the VC dimension (VCD) have been established. In particular, for finite maximum classes of a given VCD d, the RTD equals d. To date, there is no concept class known for which the ratio of RTD over VCD exceeds 3/2. However, the only known upper bound on RTD in terms of VCD is exponential in the VCD and depends on the size of the concept class. We pose the following question: is the RTD upper-bounded by a function that grows only linearly in the VCD? Answering this question would further our understanding of the relationships between the complexity of teaching and the complexity of learning from randomly chosen examples. In addition, the answer to this question, whether positive or negative, is known to have implications on the study of the long-standing open sample compression conjecture, which claims that every concept class of VCD d has a sample compression scheme in which samples for concepts in the class are compressed to subsets of size no larger than d.",

Our study helps to shed light on the design of convex calibrated surrogates. We also give a new framework for designing convex calibrated surrogates under low-noise conditions by eliciting properties that allow one to construct ‘coarse’ estimates of the underlying distribution.",

This class includes online prediction with expert advice and the multi-armed bandit problem, but also several learning problems where the online player does not necessarily observe his own loss. We analyze how the structure of the feedback graph controls the inherent difficulty of the induced T-round learning problem. Specifically, we show that any feedback graph belongs to one of three classes: \\emphstrongly observable graphs, \\emphweakly observable graphs, and \\emphunobservable graphs. We prove that the first class induces learning problems with \\widetildeΘ(α^1/2 T^1/2) minimax regret, where αis the independence number of the underlying graph; the second class induces problems with \\widetildeΘ(δ^1/3T^2/3) minimax regret, where δis the domination number of a certain portion of the graph; and the third class induces problems with linear minimax regret.

We establish learning guarantees   when the number of components scales as k=o(d^p/2), where d is the observed dimension, and p is the order of the observed moment employed in the tensor method (usually p=3,4).  In the unsupervised setting, a simple initialization algorithm based on SVD of the tensor slices is proposed, and the guarantees are provided under the stricter condition that k ≤βd (where constant βcan be larger than 1).

    "abstract": "Sparse coding is a basic task in many fields including signal processing, neuroscience and machine learning where the goal is to learn a basis that enables a sparse representation of a given set of data, if one exists. Its standard formulation is as a non-convex optimization problem which is solved in practice by heuristics based on alternating minimization.  Recent work has resulted in several algorithms for sparse coding with provable guarantees, but somewhat surprisingly these are outperformed by the simple alternating minimization heuristics. Here we give a general framework for understanding alternating minimization which we leverage to analyze existing heuristics and to design new ones also with provable guarantees. Some of these algorithms seem implementable on simple neural architectures, which was the original motivation of Olshausen and Field in introducing sparse coding. We also give the first efficient algorithm for sparse coding that works almost up to the information theoretic limit for sparse recovery on incoherent dictionaries. All previous algorithms that approached or surpassed this limit run in time exponential in some natural parameter. Finally, our algorithms improve upon the sample complexity of existing approaches. We believe that our analysis framework will have applications in other settings where simple iterative algorithms are used",

    "abstract": "We resolve an open question from Christiano (2014b) posed in COLT’14 regarding the optimal dependency of the regret achievable for online local learning on the size of the label set. In this framework, the algorithm is shown a pair of items at each step, chosen from a set of n items. The learner then predicts a label for each item, from a label set of size L and receives a real valued payoff. This is a natural framework which captures many interesting scenarios such as online gambling and online max cut. Christiano (2014a) designed an efficient online learning algorithm for this problem achieving a regret of O(\\sqrtnL^3 T), where T is the number of rounds. Information theoretically, one can achieve a regret of O(\\sqrtn \\log L T). One of the main open questions left in this framework concerns closing the above gap. In this work, we provide a complete answer to the question above via two main results. We show, via a tighter analysis, that the semi-definite programming based algorithm of Christiano (2014a) in fact achieves a regret of O(\\sqrtnLT). Second, we show a matching computational lower bound. Namely, we show that a polynomial time algorithm for online local learning with lower regret would imply a polynomial time algorithm for the planted clique problem which is widely believed to be hard. We prove a similar hardness result under a related conjecture concerning planted dense subgraphs that we put forth. Unlike planted clique, the planted dense subgraph problem does not have any known quasi-polynomial time algorithms. Computational lower bounds for online learning are relatively rare, and we hope that the ideas developed in this work will lead to lower bounds for other online learning scenarios as well.",

We provide the first polynomial time algorithm that can learn linear separators to arbitrarily small excess error in this noise model under the uniform distribution over the unit sphere in \\Re^d, for some constant value of η. While widely studied in the statistical learning theory community in the context of getting faster convergence rates, computationally efficient algorithms in this model had remained elusive. Our work provides the first evidence that one can indeed design  algorithms achieving arbitrarily small excess error in  polynomial time  under this realistic noise model and thus opens up a new and exciting line of research. We additionally provide lower bounds showing that popular algorithms such as hinge loss minimization and averaging cannot lead to arbitrarily small excess error under Massart noise, even under the uniform distribution. Our work, instead, makes use of a margin based technique developed in the context of active learning. As a result, our algorithm is also an active learning algorithm with label complexity that is only logarithmic in the desired excess error ε.",

In this work we pose and provide efficient algorithms for several natural theoretical formulations of this goal.  Specifically, we consider the problem of learning many different target functions over time, that share certain commonalities that are initially unknown to the learning algorithm.  Our aim is to learn new internal representations as the algorithm learns new target functions,  that capture this commonality and allow subsequent learning tasks to be solved more efficiently and from less data. We develop efficient algorithms for two very different kinds of commonalities that target functions might share: one based on learning common low-dimensional and unions of low-dimensional subspaces and one based on learning  nonlinear Boolean combinations of features.  Our algorithms for learning Boolean feature combinations additionally have a dual interpretation, and can be viewed as giving an efficient procedure for constructing near-optimal sparse Boolean autoencoders under a natural “anchor-set” assumption.",

For a variety of constraints on the adversary’s labels, we show that the minimax optimal strategy is linear, with a parameter choice that is reminiscent of ordinary least squares (and as easy to compute).  The predictions depend on all covariates, past and future, with a particular weighting assigned to future covariates corresponding to the role that they play in the minimax regret.  We study two families of label sequences: box constraints (under a covariate compatibility condition), and a weighted 2-norm constraint that emerges naturally from the analysis.  The strategy is adaptive in the sense that it requires no knowledge of the constraint set.  We obtain an explicit expression for the minimax regret for these games.  For the case of uniform box constraints, we show that, with worst case covariate sequences, the regret is O(d\\log T), with no dependence on the scaling of the covariates.",

The problem is reduced to sampling from an \\emphapproximately log-concave distribution using the Hit-and-Run method, which is shown to have the same \\mathcalO^* complexity as sampling from log-concave distributions. In addition to extend the analysis for log-concave distributions to approximate log-concave distributions, the implementation of the 1-dimensional sampler of the Hit-and-Run walk requires new methods and analysis. The algorithm then is based on simulated annealing which does not relies on first order conditions which makes it essentially immune to local minima. We then apply the method to different motivating problems. In the context of zeroth order stochastic convex optimization, the proposed method produces an ε-minimizer after \\mathcalO^*(n^7.5ε^-2) noisy function evaluations  by inducing a \\mathcalO(ε/n)-approximately log concave distribution. We also consider in detail the case when the “amount of non-convexity” decays towards the optimum of the function.

We show that there are kernel learning problems where no such method will lead to non-trivial computational savings.

Despite its importance and widespread use in applications, little is known about the theoretical properties of sequential information maximization, in particular under noisy observations.  In this paper, we analyze the widely used greedy policy for this task, and identify problem instances where it provides provably near-maximal utility, even in the challenging setting of persistent noise.  Our results depend on a natural separability condition associated with a channel injecting noise into the observations.

At each step, S^2 selects the vertex to be labeled based on the structure of the graph and all previously gathered labels. Specifically, S^2 queries for the label of the vertex that bisects the \\em shortest shortest path between any pair of oppositely labeled vertices. We present a theoretical estimate of the number of queries S^2 needs in terms of a novel  parametrization of the complexity of binary functions on graphs. We also present experimental results demonstrating the performance of S^2 on both real and synthetic data. While other graph-based active learning algorithms have shown promise in practice, our algorithm is the first with both good performance and theoretical guarantees. Finally, we demonstrate the implications of the S^2 algorithm to the theory of nonparametric active learning. In particular, we show that S^2 achieves near minimax optimal excess risk for an important class of nonparametric classification problems.",

Roughly, the learner’s goal is to find the best policy, or way of behaving, in some space of policies, although “best” is not always so clearly defined. Here, we propose a new and natural solution concept, rooted in game theory, called a \\emphvon Neumann winner, a randomized policy that beats or ties every other policy. We show that this notion overcomes important limitations of existing solutions, particularly the Condorcet winner which has typically been used in the past, but which requires strong and often unrealistic assumptions. We then present three \\emphefficient algorithms for online learning in our setting, and for approximating a von Neumann winner from batch-like data. The first of these algorithms achieves particularly low regret, even when data is adversarial, although its time and space requirements are linear in the size of the policy space. The other two algorithms require time and space only logarithmic in the size of the policy space when provided access to an oracle for solving classification problems on the space.",

Hartigan consistency has been used extensively as a framework to analyze such clustering algorithms from a statistical point of view. Still, as we show in the paper, a tree which is Hartigan consistent with a given density can look very different than the correct limit tree. Specifically, Hartigan consistency permits two types of undesirable configurations which we term \\emphover-segmentation and \\emphimproper nesting.  Moreover, Hartigan consistency is a limit property and does not directly quantify difference between trees. In this paper we identify two limit properties, \\emphseparation and \\emphminimality, which address both over-segmentation and improper nesting and together imply (but are not implied by) Hartigan consistency. We proceed to introduce a \\emphmerge distortion metric between hierarchical clusterings and show that convergence in our distance implies both separation and minimality. We also prove that uniform separation and minimality imply convergence in the merge distortion metric.  Furthermore, we show that our merge distortion metric is stable under perturbations of the density. Finally, we demonstrate applicability of these concepts by proving convergence results for two clustering algorithms. First, we show convergence (and hence separation and minimality) of the recent robust single linkage algorithm of Chaudhuri and Dasgupta (2010). Second, we provide convergence results on manifolds for  topological  split tree clustering.",

The value of this game is the optimal error rate achievable. For learning using a limited hypothesis class \\mathcalH over corrupted inputs, we give an efficient algorithm that given an uncorrupted sample returns a hypothesis h∈\\mathcalH whose error on adversarially corrupted inputs is near optimal. Our algorithm uses as a blackbox an oracle that solves the ERM problem for the hypothesis class \\mathcalH. We provide a generalization bound for our setting, showing that for a sufficiently large sample, the performance on the sample and future unseen corrupted inputs will be similar. This gives an efficient learning algorithm for our adversarial setting, based on an ERM oracle. We also consider an inference related setting of the problem, where given a corrupted input, the learner queries the  target function on various uncorrupted inputs and generates a prediction regarding the given corrupted input. There is no limitation on the prediction function the learner may generate, so implicitly the hypothesis class includes all possible hypotheses. In this setting we characterize the optimal learner policy as a minimum vertex cover in a given bipartite graph, and the optimal adversary policy as a maximum matching in the same bipartite graph.

We show that linear and ratio-of-linear do admit nonseparable scores, and provide evidence for a conjecture that these are the only such properties (up to link functions).

Two popular ways to formalize such adaptivity are second-order regret bounds and quantile bounds. The underlying notions of ‘easy data’, which may be paraphrased as “the learning problem has small variance” and “multiple decisions are useful”, are synergetic. But even though there are sophisticated algorithms that exploit one of the two, no existing algorithm is able to adapt to both. The difficulty in combining the two notions lies in tuning a parameter called the learning rate, whose optimal value behaves non-monotonically.  We introduce a potential function for which (very surprisingly!) it is sufficient to simply put a prior on learning rates; an approach that does not work for any previous method. By choosing the right prior we construct efficient algorithms and show that they reap both benefits by proving the first bounds that are both second-order and incorporate quantiles.",

On one hand, this new algorithm ensures small regret when the competitor has small loss and almost constant regret when the losses are stochastic. On the other hand, the algorithm is able to compete with any convex combination of the experts simultaneously, with a regret in terms of the relative entropy of the prior and the competitor. This resolves an open problem proposed by Chaudhuri et al. (2009) and Chernov and Vovk (2010). Moreover, we extend the results to the sleeping expert setting and provide two applications to illustrate the power of AdaNormalHedge: 1) competing with time-varying unknown competitors and 2) predicting almost as well as the best pruning tree. Our results on these applications significantly improve previous work from different aspects, and a special case of the first application resolves another open problem proposed by Warmuth and Koolen (2014) on whether one can simultaneously achieve optimal shifting regret for both adversarial and stochastic losses.",

The problem is hard because the loss function (i.e., the negative log-likelihood function in our problem setting) is not convex. To avoid the non-convexity, we can change parameters so that the loss function becomes convex with respect to the new parameter. But then the radius K of the reparameterized domain may be infinite, where K depends on the outcome sequence. So we put a mild assumption that guarantees that K is finite. We can thus employ standard online convex optimization algorithms, namely OGD and ONS, over the reparameterized domain, and get regret bounds O(n^\\frac12(\\ln K)\\sqrtT) and O(n^\\frac32K\\ln T), respectively, where T is the horizon of the game. The bounds roughly means that OGD is better when K is large while ONS is better when K is small. But how large can K be? We show that K can be as large as Θ(T^n-1), which implies that the worst case regret bounds of OGD and ONS are O(n^\\frac32\\sqrtT\\ln T) and \\tildeO(n^\\frac32(T)^n-1), respectively. We then propose a version of Follow the Regularized Leader, whose regret bound is close to the minimum of those of OGD and ONS. In other words, our algorithm is competitive with both for a wide range of values of K. In particular, our algorithm achieves the worst case regret bound O(n^\\frac52T^\\frac13 \\ln T), which is slightly better than OGD with respect to T.

A key aspect here is that finding the optimal benchmark predictor (even in hindsight, given all the data) might be computationally hard due to the combinatorial nature of the constraints. Despite this, we provide polynomial-time prediction algorithms that achieve low regret against combinatorial benchmark sets. We do so by building improper learning algorithms based on two ideas that work together. The first is to alleviate part of the computational burden through random playout, and the second is to employ Lasserre semidefinite hierarchies to approximate the resulting integer program. Interestingly, for our prediction algorithms, we only need to compute the values of the semidefinite programs and not the rounded solutions. However, the integrality gap for Lasserre hierarchy does enter the generic regret bound in terms of Rademacher complexity of the benchmark set. This establishes a trade-off between the computation time and the regret bound of the algorithm.",

It is an unresolved question whether there exists an “optimal PAC algorithm” which establishes a general upper bound with precisely the same order of magnitude as the general lower bound. According to a result of Auer and Ortner, there is no way for showing that arbitrary consistent algorithms are optimal because they can provably differ from optimality by factor \\log(1/ε). In contrast to this result, we show that every consistent algorithm L (even a provably suboptimal one) induces a family (L_K)_K\\ge1 of PAC algorithms (with 2K-1 calls of L as a subroutine) which come very close to optimality: the number of labeled examples needed by L_K exceeds the general lower bound only by factor \\ell_K(1/\\epsillon) where \\ell_K denotes (a truncated version of) the K-times iterated logarithm. Moreover, L_K is applicable to any concept class C of finite VC-dimension and it can be implemented efficiently whenever the consistency problem for C is feasible. We show furthermore that, for every consistent algorithm L, L_2 is an optimal PAC algorithm for precisely the same concept classes which were used by Auer and Ortner for showing the existence of suboptimal consistent algorithms.
