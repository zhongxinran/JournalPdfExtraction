    "abstract": "Multiple users getting one sample each from an unknown  distribution seek to enable a central server to conduct statistical inference. However, each player can only provide limited amount of information about its sample to the server.  We propose a unified framework to study such distributed inference problems under local information constraints.  We model the local information constraints by a set of channels $\\mathcal{W}$: each player chooses a channel from $\\mathcal{W}$, and then passes their data through this channel before transmitting the output to the server. The goal in this distributed setting is to understand the blow-up in data requirement imposed by the information constraints, compared to the centralized setting where all data samples are available to the server.  We introduce two notions of \\emph{chi-square fluctuations} which provide bounds for the  average distance and the distance to the  average of a local perturbation. When information constraints are imposed, by the standard data-processing inequality, pairwise distances contract and so do our chi-square fluctuations. We provide a precise characterization of this contraction for discrete $k$-ary distributions and use it to obtain to general lower bounds for distribution learning and testing under information constraints. Our results involve  notions of minmax and maxmin chi-square fluctuations, where  the maximum is over the choice of channels and the minimum is over perturbations. The former emerges when considering public-coin protocols for testing and is bounded in terms of Frobenius norm of a positive semidefinite matrix $H$, a function of the channel family $\\mathcal{W}$. The latter appears for private-coin protocols and is bounded by the nuclear norm of $H$ which is smaller than its Frobenius norm, establishing a separation between the sample complexity of testing using public and private coins.",

    "abstract": "We consider  online learning in an adversarial, non-convex setting under the assumption that the learner has an access to an offline optimization oracle.  In the general setting of prediction with expert advice, Hazan and Koren established that in the optimization-oracle model, online learning requires exponentially more computation than statistical learning.  In this paper we show that by slightly strengthening the oracle model, the online and the statistical learning models become computationally equivalent. Our result holds for any Lipschitz and bounded (but not necessarily convex) function.  As an application we demonstrate how the offline oracle enables efficient computation of an equilibrium in non-convex games, that include GAN (generative adversarial networks) as a special case.",

    "abstract": "Algorithms often must solve sequences of closely related problems. If the algorithm runs a standard procedure with worst-case runtime guarantees on each instance, it will fail to take advantage of valuable structure shared across the problem instances. When a commuter drives from work to home, for example, there are typically only a handful of routes that will ever be the shortest path. A na√Øve algorithm that does not exploit this common structure may spend most of its time checking roads that will never be in the shortest path. More generally, we can often ignore large swaths of the search space that will likely never contain an optimal solution. We present an algorithm that learns to maximally prune the search space on repeated computations, thereby reducing runtime while provably outputting the correct solution each period with high probability. Our algorithm employs a simple explore-exploit technique resembling those used in online algorithms, though our setting is quite different. We prove that, with respect to our model of pruning search spaces, our approach is optimal up to constant factors. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of our model and algorithm to three classic problems: shortest-path routing, string search, and linear programming. We present experiments confirming that our simple algorithm is effective at significantly reducing the runtime of solving repeated computations.",

A distribution $p$ over a poset is {\\em monotone} if, for any pair of domain elements $x$ and $y$ such that $x \\preceq y$, $p(x) \\leq p(y)$. To understand the sample complexity of this problem, we introduce a new property called \\emph{bigness} over a finite domain, where the distribution is $T$-big if the minimum probability for any domain element is at least $T$. We establish a lower bound of $\\Omega(n/\\log n)$ for testing bigness of distributions on  domains of size $n$. We then build on  these lower bounds to give $\\Omega(n/\\log{n})$ lower bounds for  testing monotonicity over a matching poset of size $n$ and significantly improved lower bounds over the hypercube poset. We give sublinear sample complexity bounds for testing bigness and for testing monotonicity over the matching poset.   We then give a number of tools for analyzing upper bounds on the sample complexity of the monotonicity testing problem.",

    "abstract": "There has been significant study on the sample complexity of testing properties of distributions over large domains.  For many properties, it is known that the sample complexity can be substantially smaller than the domain size. For example, over a domain of size $n$, distinguishing the uniform distribution from distributions that are far from uniform in $\\ell_1$-distance uses only $O(\\sqrt{n})$ samples.  However, the picture is very different in the presence of arbitrary noise, even when the amount of noise is quite small.  In this case, one must distinguish if samples are coming from a distribution that is $\\epsilon$-close to uniform from the case where the distribution is $(1-\\epsilon)$-far from uniform.  The latter task requires nearly linear in $n$ samples (Valiant, 2008; Valiant and Valiant, 2017a). In this work, we present a noise model that on one hand is more tractable for the testing problem, and on the other hand represents a rich class of noise families.   In our model, the noisy distribution is a mixture of the original distribution and noise, where the latter is known to the tester either explicitly or via sample access; the form of the noise is also known \\emph{a priori}.  Focusing on the identity and closeness testing problems leads to the following mixture testing question:  Given samples of distributions $p, q_1,q_2$, can we test if $p$ is a mixture of $q_1$ and $q_2$?  We consider this general question in various scenarios that differ in terms of how the tester can access the distributions, and show that indeed this problem is more tractable.  Our results  show that the sample complexity of our testers are exactly the same as for the classical non-mixture case.",

We obtain the explicit rates for the multivariate martingale CLT using a combination of Stein?s method and Lindeberg?s argument, which is then used in conjunction with a non-asymptotic analysis of averaged SGD proposed in [PJ92]. Our results have potentially interesting consequences for computing confidence intervals for parameter estimation with SGD and constructing hypothesis tests with SGD that are valid in a non-asymptotic sense",

    "abstract": "We consider the following fundamental problem in the study of neural networks: given input examples $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ and their vector-valued labels, as defined by an underlying generative neural network, recover the weight matrices of this network. We consider two-layer networks, mapping $\\mathbb{R}^d$ to $\\mathbb{R}^m$, with a single hidden layer and $k$ non-linear activation units $f(\\cdot)$, where $f(x) = \\max \\{x , 0\\}$ is the ReLU activation function. Such a network is specified by two weight matrices, $\\mathbf{U}^* \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times k}, \\mathbf{V}^* \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k \\times d}$, such that the label of an example $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is given by $\\mathbf{U}^* f(\\mathbf{V}^* x)$, where $f(\\cdot)$ is applied coordinate-wise. Given $n$ samples $x^1,‚Ä¶,x^n \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ as a matrix $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times n}$ and the label $\\mathbf{U}^* f(\\mathbf{V}^* \\mathbf{X})$ of the network on these samples, our goal is to recover the weight matrices $\\mathbf{U}^*$ and $\\mathbf{V}^*$. More generally, our labels $\\mathbf{U}^* f(\\mathbf{V}^* \\mathbf{X})$  may be corrupted by noise, and instead we observe $\\mathbf{U}^* f(\\mathbf{V}^* \\mathbf{X}) + \\mathbf{E}$ where $\\mathbf{E}$ is some noise matrix. Even in this case, we may still be interested in recovering good approximations to the weight matrices $\\mathbf{U}^*$ and $\\mathbf{V}^*$.  In this work, we develop algorithms and hardness results under varying assumptions on the input and noise. Although the problem is NP-hard even for $k=2$, by assuming Gaussian marginals over the input $\\mathbf{X}$ we are able to develop polynomial time algorithms for the approximate recovery of $\\mathbf{U}^*$ and $\\mathbf{V}^*$. Perhaps surprisingly, in the noiseless case our algorithms recover $\\mathbf{U}^*,\\mathbf{V}^*$ \\textit{exactly}, i.e. with no error, in \\textit{strongly} polynomial time. To the best of the our knowledge, this is the first algorithm to accomplish exact recovery for the ReLU activation function. For the noisy case, we give the first polynomial time algorithm that approximately recovers the weights in the presence of mean-zero noise $\\mathbf{E}$. Our algorithms generalize to a larger class of \\textit{rectified} activation functions, $f(x) = 0$ when $x\\leq 0$, and $f(x) > 0$ otherwise. Although our polynomial time results require $\\mathbf{U}^*$ to have full column rank, we also give a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm (in $k$) when $\\mathbf{U}^*$ does not have this property. Lastly, we give a  fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for more arbitrary noise matrices $\\mathbf{E}$, so long as they are independent of $\\mathbf{X}$.",

We consider identity testing for both soft-constraint and hard-constraint systems. In particular, we prove hardness results in two prototypical cases, the \\emph{Ising model} and \\emph{proper colorings}, and explore whether identity testing is easier than structure learning. For the ferromagnetic (attractive) Ising model, Daskalasis et al. (2018) presented a polynomial time algorithm for identity testing. We prove hardness results in the antiferromagnetic (repulsive) setting in the same regime of parameters where structure learning is known to require a super-polynomial number of samples. Specifically, for $n$-vertex graphs of maximum degree $d$, we prove that if $|\\beta| d = \\omega(\\log{n})$ (where $\\beta$ is the inverse temperature parameter), then there is no identity testing algorithm  for the antiferromagnetic Ising model  that runs in polynomial time unless $RP\\!=\\!NP$. We also establish computational lower bounds for a broader set of parameters under the (randomized) exponential time hypothesis. In our proofs, we  use random graphs as gadgets; this is inspired by similar constructions in seminal works on the hardness of approximate¬†counting. In the hard-constraint setting, we present hardness results  for identity testing for proper colorings.   Our results are based on the presumed hardness of \\textsc{#BIS}, the problem of (approximately) counting independent sets in bipartite graphs. In particular, we prove that identity testing for colorings is hard in the same range of parameters  where structure learning is known to be hard, which in turn matches the parameter regime for  NP-hardness of the corresponding decision problem.",

The problem has received a lot of attention in signal processing, learning, and theoretical computer science. The problem is formalized as factorizing a matrix $X (d \\times n)$ (whose columns are the signals) as $X = AY$, where $A$ has a prescribed number $m$ of columns (typically $m \\ll n$), and $Y$ has columns that are $k$-sparse (typically $k \\ll d$). Most of the known theoretical results involve assuming that the columns of the unknown $A$ have certain incoherence properties, and that the coefficient matrix $Y$ has random (or partly random) structure.  The goal of our work is to understand what can be said in the absence of such assumptions. Can we still find $A$ and $Y$ such that $X \\approx AY$? We show that this is possible, if we allow violating the bounds on $m$ and $k$ by appropriate factors that depend on $k$ and the desired approximation. Our results rely on an algorithm for what we call the threshold correlation problem, which turns out to be related to hypercontractive norms of matrices. We also show that our algorithmic ideas apply to a setting in which some of the columns of $X$ are outliers, thus giving similar guarantees even in this challenging setting.",

A remarkable result due to Yatracos shows that this problem is tractable in the following sense: there exists an algorithm that uses  $O(\\epsilon^{-2})$ samples from $p$ and outputs¬†$q_i$ such that with high probability, $TV(q_i,p) \\leq 3\\cdot OPT + \\epsilon$, where $OPT= \\min\\{TV(q_1,p),TV(q_2,p)\\}$. Moreover, this result extends to any finite class of densities $\\mathcal{Q}$: there exists an algorithm that outputs the best density in $\\mathcal{Q}$ up to a multiplicative approximation factor of 3. We complement and extend this result by showing that: (i) the factor 3 can not be improved if one restricts the algorithm to output a density from $\\mathcal{Q}$, and (ii) if one allows the algorithm to output arbitrary densities (e.g. a mixture of densities from $\\mathcal{Q}$),  then the approximation factor can be reduced to 2, which is optimal. In particular this demonstrates an advantage of improper learning over proper in this setup. We develop two approaches to achieve the optimal approximation factor of $2$: an adaptive one and a static one. Both approaches are based on a geometric point of view of the problem and rely on estimating surrogate metrics to the total variation.

All previous reductions either fail to show tight computational lower bounds matching existing algorithms or show lower bounds for formulations of sparse PCA other than its canonical generative model, the spiked covariance model. Also, these lower bounds all quickly degrade given weak forms of the $\\textsc{pc}$ conjecture. We give a reduction from $\\textsc{pc}$ that yields the first full characterization of the computational barrier in the spiked covariance model, providing tight lower bounds at all sparsities $k$. We also show the surprising result that even a mild improvement in the signal strength needed by the best known polynomial-time sparse PCA algorithms would imply that the hardness threshold for $\\textsc{pc}$ is $\\text{polylog}(N)$, rather than on the order $N^{1/2}$ as is widely conjectured.

    "abstract": "We study adaptive regret bounds in terms of the variation of the losses (the so-called path-length bounds) for both multi-armed bandit and more generally linear bandit. We first show that the seemingly suboptimal path-length bound of (Wei and Luo, 2018) is in fact not improvable for adaptive adversary. Despite this negative result, we then develop two new algorithms, one that strictly improves over (Wei and Luo, 2018) with a smaller path-length measure, and the other which improves over (Wei and Luo, 2018) for oblivious adversary when the path-length is large. Our algorithms are based on the well-studied optimistic mirror descent framework, but importantly with several novel techniques, including new optimistic predictions, a slight bias towards recently selected arms, and the use of a hybrid regularizer similar to that of (Bubeck et al., 2018). Furthermore, we extend our results to linear bandit by showing a reduction to obtaining dynamic regret for a full-information problem, followed by a further reduction to convex body chasing. As a consequence we obtain new dynamic regret results as well as the first path-length regret bounds for general linear bandit.",

To analyze more complex ranking data, several studies considered the Generalized Mallows model defined by Fligner and Verducci 1986. Despite the significant research interest of ranking distributions, the exact sample complexity of estimating the parameters of a Mallows and a Generalized Mallows Model is not well-understood. The main result of the paper is a tight sample complexity bound for learning Mallows and Generalized Mallows Model. We approach the learning problem by analyzing a more general model which interpolates between the single parameter Mallows Model and the $m$ parameter Mallows model. We call our model Mallows Block Model ‚Äì referring to the Block Models that are a popular model in theoretical statistics. Our sample complexity analysis gives tight bound for learning the Mallows Block Model for any number of blocks. We provide essentially matching lower bounds for our sample complexity results. As a corollary of our analysis, it turns out that, if the central ranking is known, one single sample from the Mallows Block Model is sufficient to estimate the spread parameters with error that goes to zero as the size of the permutations goes to infinity. In addition, we calculate the exact rate of the parameter estimation error.",

    "abstract": "Gaussian processes (GP) are a stochastic processes, used  as Bayesian approach for the optimization of black-box functions. Despite their effectiveness in simple problems, GP-based algorithms hardly scale to high-dimensional functions, as their per-iteration time and space cost is at least \\emph{quadratic} in the number of dimensions $d$ and iterations¬†$t$. Given a set of $A$ alternatives to choose from, the overall runtime $O(t^3 A)$ is prohibitive.  In this paper, we introduce BKB (\\textit{budgeted kernelized bandit}), a new approximate GP algorithm for optimization under bandit feedback that achieves near-optimal regret (and hence near-optimal convergence rate) with near-constant per-iteration complexity and remarkably no assumption on the input space or covariance of the GP. We combine a kernelized linear bandit algorithm (GP-UCB)  leverage score sampling as a randomized matrix sketching and  prove that selecting inducing points based on their posterior variance gives an accurate low-rank approximation of the GP, preserving variance estimates and confidence intervals. As a consequence, BKB does not suffer from \\emph{variance starvation}, an important problem faced by many previous sparse GP approximations. Moreover, we show that our procedure selects at most $\\widetilde{O}(d_{eff})$ points, where $d_{eff}$ is the \\emph{effective} dimension of the explored space, which is typically much smaller than both $d$ and $t$. This greatly reduces the dimensionality of the problem, thus leading to a $O(T A d_{eff}^2)$ runtime and $O(A d_{eff})$ space complexity.",

Indeed, the question of whether a robust classifier for their task exists in the large perturbation regime seems related to important open questions in computational number theory. In this work, we extend their work in three directions. First, we demonstrate classification tasks where computationally efficient robust classification is impossible, even when computationally unbounded robust classifiers exist. For this, we rely on the existence of average-case hard functions, requiring no cryptographic assumptions. Second, we show hard-to-robustly-learn classification tasks in the large-perturbation regime. Namely, we show that even though an efficient classifier that is very robust (namely, tolerant to large perturbations) exists, it is computationally hard to learn any non-trivial robust classifier. Our first construction relies on the existence of one-way functions, a minimal assumption in cryptography, and the second on the hardness of the learning parity with noise problem. In the latter setting, not only does a non-robust classifier exist, but also an efficient algorithm that generates fresh new labeled samples given access to polynomially many training examples (termed as generation by Kearns et al. (1994)). Third, we show that any such counterexample implies the existence of cryptographic primitives such as one-way functions or even forms of public-key encryption. This leads us to a win-win scenario: either we can quickly learn an efficient robust classifier, or we can construct new instances of popular and useful cryptographic primitives.",

    "abstract": "Given a fixed $n\\times d$ matrix $\\mathbf{X}$, where $n\\gg d$, we study the complexity of sampling from a  distribution over all subsets of rows where the probability of a subset is proportional to the squared volume of the parallelepiped spanned by the rows (a.k.a.¬†a determinantal point process). In this task, it is important to minimize the preprocessing cost of the procedure (performed once) as well as the  sampling cost (performed repeatedly). To that end, we propose a new determinantal point process algorithm which has the following two properties, both of which are novel: (1) a preprocessing step which runs in time $O\\big(\\text{number-of-non-zeros}(\\mathbf{X})\\cdot\\log n\\big)+\\text{poly}(d)$, and (2) a sampling step which runs in $\\text{poly}(d)$ time, independent of the number of rows $n$. We achieve this by introducing a new \\textit{regularized} determinantal point process (R-DPP), which serves as an intermediate distribution in the sampling procedure by reducing the number of rows from $n$ to $\\text{poly}(d)$. Crucially, this intermediate distribution does not distort the probabilities of the target sample. Our key novelty in defining the R-DPP  is the use of a Poisson random variable for controlling the probabilities of different subset sizes, leading to new determinantal formulas such as the normalization constant for this distribution. Our algorithm has applications in many diverse areas where determinantal point processes have been used, such as  machine learning, stochastic optimization, data summarization and low-rank matrix reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "In experimental design, we are given a large collection of vectors, each with a hidden response value that we assume derives from an underlying linear model, and we wish to pick a small subset of the vectors such that querying the corresponding responses will lead to a good estimator of the model.   A classical approach in statistics is to assume the responses are linear, plus zero-mean i.i.d. Gaussian noise, in which case the goal is to provide an unbiased estimator with smallest mean squared error (A-optimal design).   A related approach, more common in computer science, is to assume the responses are arbitrary but fixed, in which case the goal is to estimate the least squares solution using few responses, as quickly as possible, for worst-case inputs.    Despite many attempts, characterizing the relationship between these two approaches has proven elusive.   We address this by proposing a framework for experimental  design where the responses are produced by an arbitrary unknown distribution.   We show that there is an efficient randomized experimental design procedure that achieves strong variance bounds for an unbiased estimator using few responses  in this general model. Nearly tight bounds for the classical A-optimality criterion, as well as improved bounds for worst-case responses, emerge as special cases of this result.   In the process, we develop a new algorithm for a joint sampling distribution called volume sampling, and we propose a new i.i.d. importance sampling method: inverse score sampling.   A key novelty of our analysis is in developing new expected error bounds for worst-case regression by controlling the tail behavior of i.i.d. sampling via the jointness of volume sampling.   Our result motivates a new minimax-optimality criterion for experimental design with unbiased estimators, which can be viewed as an extension of both A-optimal design and sampling for worst-case regression.",

Histograms are one of the most fundamental nonparametric families of distributions and have been extensively studied in computer science and statistics. We give the first identity tester for this problem with {\\em sub-learning} sample complexity in any fixed dimension and a nearly-matching sample complexity lower bound. In more detail, let $q$ be an unknown $d$-dimensional $k$-histogram distribution in fixed dimension $d$,  and $p$ be an explicitly given $d$-dimensional $k$-histogram. We want to correctly distinguish, with probability at least $2/3$, between the case that $p = q$ versus $\\|p-q\\|_1 \\geq \\epsilon$.

A notable weakness of most stability-based generalization bounds is that they hold only in expectation. Generalization with high probability has been established in a landmark paper of Bousquet and Elisseeff (2001) albeit at the expense of an additional $\\sqrt{n}$ factor in the bound. Specifically, their bound on the estimation error of any $\\gamma$-uniformly stable learning algorithm on $n$ samples and range in $[0,1]$ is $O(\\gamma \\sqrt{n \\log(1/\\delta)} + \\sqrt{\\log(1/\\delta)/n})$ with probability  $\\geq 1-\\delta$. The $\\sqrt{n}$ overhead makes the bound vacuous in the common settings where $\\gamma \\geq 1/\\sqrt{n}$. A stronger bound was recently proved by the authors (Feldman and Vondrak, 2018) that reduces the overhead to at most $O(n^{1/4})$. Still, both of these results give optimal generalization bounds only when $\\gamma = O(1/n)$. We prove a nearly tight bound of $O(\\gamma \\log(n)\\log(n/\\delta) + \\sqrt{\\log(1/\\delta)/n})$ on the estimation error of any $\\gamma$-uniformly stable algorithm.

In agnostic tensor completion, we make \\emph{no assumption} on the rank of the unknown tensor, but attempt to predict unknown entries as well as the best rank-$r$ tensor. For agnostic learning of third-order tensors with the square loss, we give the first polynomial time algorithm that obtains a ‚Äúfast‚Äù (i.e., $O(1/n)$-type) rate improving over the rate obtained by reduction to matrix completion. Our prediction error rate to compete with the best $d\\times{}d\\times{}d$ tensor of rank-$r$ is $\\tilde{O}(r^{2}d^{3/2}/n)$.

This unlocks the standard toolbox for localization of empirical processes under the square loss, and allows us to establish restricted eigenvalue-type guarantees for various tensor regression models, with tensor completion as a special case.

Notably, we show that in the global oracle/statistical learning model, only logarithmic dependence on smoothness is required to find a near-stationary point, whereas polynomial dependence on smoothness is necessary in the local stochastic oracle model. In other words, the separation in complexity between the two models can be exponential, and the folklore understanding that smoothness is required to find stationary points is only weakly true for statistical learning. Our upper bounds are based on extensions of a recent ‚Äúrecursive regularization‚Äù technique proposed by Allen-Zhu (2018).

We analyze a two-stage sample splitting meta-algorithm that takes as input two arbitrary estimation algorithms: one for the target model and one for the nuisance model. We show that if the population risk satisfies a condition called Neyman orthogonality, the impact of the nuisance estimation error on the excess risk bound achieved by the meta-algorithm is of second order. Our theorem is agnostic to the particular algorithms used for the target and nuisance and only makes an assumption on their individual performance. This enables the use of a plethora of existing results from statistical learning and machine learning literature to give new guarantees for learning with a nuisance component. Moreover, by focusing on excess risk rather than parameter estimation, we can give guarantees under weaker assumptions than in previous works and accommodate the case where the target parameter belongs to a complex nonparametric class. We characterize conditions on the metric entropy such that oracle rates‚Äîrates of the same order as if we knew the nuisance model‚Äîare achieved.

For this problem, all existing regret minimization algorithms for the fully-adversarial setting are based on a positive semidefinite convex relaxation, and hence require quadratic memory and SVD computation (either thin of full) on each iteration, which amounts to at least quadratic runtime per iteration. This is in stark contrast to a corresponding stochastic i.i.d. variant of the problem, which was studied extensively lately, and admits very efficient gradient ascent algorithms that work directly on the natural non-convex formulation of the problem, and hence require only linear memory and linear runtime per iteration. This raises the question: \\textit{can non-convex online gradient ascent algorithms be shown to minimize regret in online adversarial settings?} In this paper we take a step forward towards answering this question. We introduce an \\textit{adversarially-perturbed spiked-covariance model} in which, each data point is assumed to follow a fixed stochastic distribution with a non-zero spectral gap in the covariance matrix,  but is then perturbed with some adversarial vector. This model is a natural extension of a well studied standard \\textit{stochastic} setting that allows for non-stationary (adversarial) patterns to arise in the data  and hence, might serve as a significantly better approximation for real-world data-streams. We show that in an interesting regime of parameters, when the non-convex online gradient ascent algorithm is initialized with a ‚Äúwarm-start\" vector, it provably minimizes the regret with high probability. We further discuss the possibility of computing such a ‚Äúwarm-start\" vector, and also the use of regularization to obtain fast regret rates.

While classical theoretical analysis of SGD for convex problems studies (suffix) \\emph{averages} of iterates and obtains information theoretically optimal bounds on suboptimality, the \\emph{last point} of SGD is, by far, the most preferred choice in practice. The best known results for last point of SGD (Shamir and Zhang, 2013) however, are suboptimal compared to information theoretic lower bounds by a $\\log T$ factor, where $T$ is the number of iterations. Harvey et. al (2018) shows that in fact, this additional $\\log T$ factor is tight for standard step size sequences of $\\OTheta{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{t}}}$ and $\\OTheta{\\frac{1}{t}}$ for non-strongly convex and strongly convex settings, respectively. Similarly, even for subgradient descent (GD) when applied to non-smooth, convex functions, the best known step-size sequences still lead to $O(\\log T)$-suboptimal convergence rates (on the final iterate). The main contribution of this work is to design new step size sequences that enjoy information theoretically optimal bounds on the suboptimality of \\emph{last point} of SGD as well as GD. We achieve this by designing a modification scheme, that converts one sequence of step sizes to another so that the last point of SGD/GD with modified sequence has the same suboptimality guarantees as the average of SGD/GD with original sequence. We also show that our result holds with high-probability. We validate our results through simulations which demonstrate that the new step size sequence indeed improves the final iterate significantly compared to the standard step size sequences.",

The basic setting is that the objective is the sum of two convex functions: the first function is smooth with up to the d-th order derivative information available, and the second function is possibly non-smooth, but its proximal tensor mappings can be computed approximately in an efficient manner. The problem is to find ‚Äì in that setting ‚Äì the best possible (optimal) iteration complexity for convex optimization. Along that line, for the smooth case (without the second non-smooth part in the objective), Nesterov (1983) proposed an optimal algorithm for the first-order methods (d=1) with iteration complexity O( 1 / k^2 ).  A high-order tensor algorithm with iteration complexity of O( 1 / k^{d+1} ) was proposed by Baes (2009) and Nesterov (2018). In this paper, we propose a new high-order tensor algorithm for the general composite case, with the iteration complexity of O( 1 / k^{(3d+1)/2} ), which matches the lower bound for the d-th order methods as established in Nesterov (2018) and Shamir et al. (2018), and hence is optimal. Our approach is based on the  Accelerated Hybrid Proximal Extragradient (A-HPE) framework proposed in Monteiro and Svaiter (2013), where a bisection procedure is installed for each A-HPE iteration. At each bisection step a proximal tensor subproblem is approximately solved, and the total number of bisection steps per A-HPE iteration is bounded by a logarithmic factor in the precision required.",

In this setting, the learner receives a subgradient of the loss functions corrupted by sub-exponential noise and strives to achieve optimal regret guarantee, without knowledge of the competitor norm, i.e., in a parameter-free way. Recently, Cutkosky and Boahen (COLT 2017) proved that, given unbounded subgradients, it is impossible to guarantee a sublinear regret due to an exponential penalty. This paper shows that it is possible to go around the lower bound by allowing the observed subgradients to be unbounded via stochastic noise. However, the presence of unbounded noise in unconstrained OCO is challenging; existing algorithms do not provide near-optimal regret bounds or fail to have a guarantee. So, we design a novel parameter-free OCO algorithm for Banach space, which we call BANCO, via a reduction to betting on noisy coins. We show that BANCO achieves the optimal regret rate in our problem. Finally, we show the application of our results to obtain a parameter-free locally private stochastic subgradient descent algorithm, and the connection to the law of iterated logarithms.",

Despite this, current bounds for the Langevin algorithms are worse than those of competing algorithms in many important situations, for instance when sampling from weakly log-concave distributions, or when sampling or optimizing non-convex log-densities. We obtain improved bounds in many of these situations, showing that the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) is faster than the best bounds for its competitor algorithms when the target distribution satisfies weak third- and fourth- order regularity properties associated with the input data. In many settings, our regularity conditions are weaker than the usual Euclidean operator norm regularity properties, allowing us to show faster bounds for a much larger class of distributions than would be possible with the usual Euclidean operator norm approach,  including in statistics and machine learning applications where the data satisfy a certain incoherence condition. In particular, we show that using our regularity conditions one can obtain faster bounds for applications which include sampling problems in Bayesian logistic regression with weakly convex priors, and the nonconvex optimization problem of learning linear classifiers with zero-one loss functions. Our main technical contribution is an analysis of the Metropolis acceptance probability of MALA in terms of its ‚Äúenergy-conservation error,\" and a bound for this error in terms of third- and fourth- order regularity conditions. The combination of this higher-order analysis of the energy conservation error with the conductance method is key to obtaining bounds which have a sub-linear dependence on the dimension $d$ in the non-strongly logconcave setting.",

Motivated by a problem of communication security, we focus on the case where the planted structure consists in the addition of a tree graph.  In the case of planted line graphs, we establish the following phase diagram for detection and reconstruction. In a low density region where the average degree $\\lambda$ of the original graph is below some critical value $\\lambda_c=1$, both detection and reconstruction go from  impossible to easy as the line length $K$ crosses some critical value $K^*=\\ln(n)/\\ln(1/\\lambda)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph.

This evolution can be defined through a partial differential equation or, equivalently, as the gradient flow in the Wasserstein space of probability distributions. Earlier work shows that (under some regularity assumptions), the mean field description is accurate as soon as the number of hidden units is much larger than the dimension $D$. In this paper we establish stronger and more general approximation guarantees. First of all, we show that the number of hidden units only needs to be larger than a quantity dependent on the regularity properties of the data, and independent of the dimensions. Next, we generalize this analysis to the case of unbounded activation functions, which was not covered by earlier bounds.  We extend our results to noisy stochastic gradient descent.

    "abstract": "We consider the combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem, where the reward function is nonlinear. In this setting, the agent chooses a batch of arms on each round and receives feedback from each arm of the batch. The reward that the agent aims to maximize is a function of the selected arms and their expectations. In many applications, the reward function is highly nonlinear, and the performance of existing algorithms relies on a global Lipschitz constant to encapsulate the function‚Äôs nonlinearity. This may lead to loose regret bounds, since by itself, a large gradient does not necessarily cause a large regret, but only in regions where the uncertainty in the reward‚Äôs parameters is high.  To overcome this problem, we introduce a new smoothness criterion, which we term \\emph{Gini-weighted smoothness}, that takes into account both the nonlinearity of the reward and concentration properties of the arms. We show that a linear dependence of the regret in the batch size in existing algorithms can be replaced by this smoothness parameter. This, in turn, leads to much tighter regret bounds when the smoothness parameter is batch-size independent. For example, in the probabilistic maximum coverage (PMC) problem, that has many applications, including influence maximization, diverse recommendations and more, we achieve dramatic improvements in the upper bounds. We also prove matching lower bounds for the PMC problem and show that our algorithm is tight, up to a logarithmic factor in the problem‚Äôs parameters.",

A fundamental obstacle that comes up in the design of such adaptive algorithms is to calibrate a so-called step-size or learning rate hyperparameter depending on variance, gradient norms, etc. A recent technique promises to overcome this difficulty by maintaining multiple learning rates in parallel. This technique has been applied in the MetaGrad algorithm for online convex optimization and the Squint algorithm for prediction with expert advice. However, in both cases the user still has to provide in advance a Lipschitz hyperparameter that bounds the norm of the gradients. Although this hyperparameter is typically not available in advance, tuning it correctly is crucial: if it is set too small, the methods may fail completely; but if it is taken too large, performance deteriorates significantly. In the present work we remove this Lipschitz hyperparameter by designing new versions of MetaGrad and Squint that adapt to its optimal value automatically. We achieve this by dynamically updating the set of active learning rates. For MetaGrad, we further improve the computational efficiency of handling constraints on the domain of prediction, and we remove the need to specify the number of rounds in advance.",

To give one concrete example, suppose that we are given access to an arbitrary binary sequence $x_1, \\ldots, x_n$ of length $n$.

We shall consider this problem in the setting of non-compact metric spaces, where the regression function need not attain its extrema. In this setting we determine the minimax optimal learning rates (up to logarithmic factors). The rate displays interesting threshold behaviour: When the regression function approaches its extrema at a sufficient rate, the optimal learning rates are of the same order as those obtained in the label-noise free setting. If the regression function approaches its extrema more gradually then classification performance necessarily degrades. In addition, we present an adaptive algorithm which attains these rates without prior knowledge of either the distributional parameters or the local density. This identifies for the first time a scenario in which finite sample rates are achievable in the label noise setting, but they differ from the optimal rates without label noise.",

Our analysis yields the following results: (i) for a given step-size, we show that the lower-order moments can be made small as a function of the step-size and can be upper-bounded by the moments of a Gaussian random variable; (ii) we show that the higher-order moments beyond a threshold may be infinite in steady-state; and (iii) we characterize the number of samples needed for the finite-time bounds to be of the same order as the steady-state bounds. As a by-product of our analysis, we also solve the open problem of obtaining finite-time bounds for the performance of temporal difference learning algorithms with linear function approximation and a constant step-size, without requiring a projection step or an i.i.d. noise assumption.",

    "header": "Robustness of Spectral Methods for Community Detection",
    "abstract": "The present work is concerned with community detection. Specifically, we consider a random graph drawn according to the stochastic block model: its vertex set is partitioned into blocks, or communities, and edges are placed randomly and independently of each other with probability depending only on the communities of their two endpoints. In this context, our aim is to recover the community labels better than by random guess, based only on the observation of the graph. In the sparse case, where edge probabilities are in $O(1/n)$, we introduce a new spectral method based on the distance matrix $D^{(\\ell)}$, where $D^{(\\ell)}_{ij} = 1$ iff the graph distance between $i$ and $j$, noted $d(i, j)$ is equal to $\\ell$. We show that when $\\ell \\sim c\\log(n)$ for carefully chosen $c$, the eigenvectors associated to the largest eigenvalues of $D^{(\\ell)}$ provide enough information to perform non-trivial community recovery with high probability, provided we are above the so-called Kesten-Stigum threshold. This yields an efficient algorithm for community detection, since computation of the matrix $D^{(\\ell)}$ can be done in $O(n^{1+\\kappa})$ operations for a small constant $\\kappa$.  We then study the sensitivity of the eigendecomposition of $D^{(\\ell)}$ when we allow an adversarial perturbation of the edges of $G$. We show that when the considered perturbation does not affect more than $O(n^\\varepsilon)$ vertices for some small $\\varepsilon > 0$, the highest eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors incur negligible perturbations, which allows us to still perform efficient recovery. Our proposed spectral method therefore: i) is robust to larger perturbations than prior spectral methods,  while semi-definite programming (or SDP) methods can tolerate yet larger perturbations; ii) achieves  non-trivial detection down to the KS threshold, which is conjectured to be optimal and is beyond reach of  existing SDP approaches; iii) is faster than SDP approaches.",

While structural and computational properties of max-entropy distributions have been extensively studied,  basic questions such as: Do max-entropy distributions over a large support  (e.g., $2^m$) with a specified marginal vector have succinct descriptions (polynomial-size in the input description)? and: Are entropy maximizing distributions ‚Äústable‚Äù under the perturbation of the marginal vector? have resisted a rigorous resolution. Here we show that these questions are related and resolve both of them. Our main result shows  a ${\\rm poly}(m, \\log 1/\\varepsilon)$ bound on the bit complexity of $\\varepsilon$-optimal dual solutions to the maximum entropy convex program ‚Äì for very general support sets and with no restriction on the marginal vector. Applications of this result include polynomial time algorithms to compute  max-entropy distributions over several new and old polytopes for any marginal vector in a unified manner, a  polynomial time algorithm to compute the Brascamp-Lieb constant in the rank-1 case. The proof of this result allows us to show that changing the marginal vector by $\\delta$ changes the max-entropy distribution in the total variation distance roughly by a factor of ${\\rm poly}(m, \\log 1/\\delta)\\sqrt{\\delta}$ ‚Äì even when the size of the support set is exponential.

Existing results in this setting either don‚Äôt guarantee consistent estimates or can only handle a small fraction of corruptions. We also extend our estimator to robust sparse linear regression and show that similar guarantees hold in this setting. Finally, we apply our estimator to the problem of linear regression with heavy-tailed noise and show that our estimator consistently estimates the regression vector even when the noise has unbounded variance (e.g., Cauchy distribution), for which most existing results don‚Äôt even apply. Our estimator is based on a novel variant of outlier removal via hard thresholding in which the threshold is chosen adaptively and crucially relies on randomness to escape bad fixed points of the non-convex hard thresholding operation.",

Our algorithms have sample complexity governed by a new structural parameter called the witness rank, which we show to be small in several settings of interest, including factored MDPs. We also show that the witness rank is never larger than the recently proposed Bellman rank parameter governing the sample complexity of the model-free algorithm OLIVE (Jiang et al., 2017), the only other provably sample-efficient algorithm for global exploration at this level of generality. Focusing on the special case of factored MDPs, we prove an exponential lower bound for a general class of model-free approaches, including OLIVE, which, when combined with our algorithmic results, demonstrates exponential separation between model-based and model-free RL in some rich-observation settings.",

The technique also benefits from comfortable tightness guarantees, meaning that unsatisfactory results can be improved only by changing the setting. We use the approach for analyzing deterministic and stochastic first-order methods under different assumptions on the nature of the stochastic noise. Among others, we treat unstructured noise with bounded variance, different noise models arising in over-parametrized expectation minimization problems, and randomized block-coordinate descent schemes.",

Motivated by recent empirical success of RL on continuous control tasks, we study the sample complexity of popular model-based and model-free algorithms on the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR).  We show that for policy evaluation, a simple model-based plugin method requires asymptotically less samples than the classical least-squares temporal difference (LSTD) estimator to reach the same quality of solution; the sample complexity gap between the two methods can be at least a factor of state dimension.  For policy optimization, we study a simple family of problem instances and show that nominal (certainty equivalence principle) control also requires several factors of state and input dimension fewer samples than the policy gradient method to reach the same level of control performance on these instances.  Furthermore, the gap persists even when employing baselines commonly used in practice.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical result which demonstrates a separation in the sample complexity between model-based and model-free methods on a continuous control task.",

We analyze Gradient Descent applied to learning a bounded target function on $n$ real-valued inputs.  %by training a neural network with a single hidden layer of nonlinear gates. We give an agnostic learning guarantee for GD: starting from a randomly initialized network, it converges in mean squared loss to the minimum error (in $2$-norm) of the best approximation of the target function using a polynomial of degree at most $k$. Moreover, for any $k$, the size of the network and number of iterations needed are both bounded by $n^{O(k)}\\log(1/\\epsilon)$. The core of our analysis is the following existence theorem, which is of independent interest:  for any $\\epsilon > 0$, any bounded function that has a degree $k$ polynomial approximation with error $\\epsilon_0$ (in $2$-norm), can be approximated to within error $\\epsilon_0 + \\epsilon$ as a linear combination of $n^{O(k)}\\cdot \\mbox{poly}(1/\\epsilon)$ {\\em randomly chosen} gates from any class of gates whose corresponding activation function has nonzero coefficients in its harmonic expansion for degrees up to $k$. In particular, this applies to training networks  of unbiased sigmoids and ReLUs.  We also rigorously explain the empirical finding that gradient descent discovers lower frequency Fourier components before higher frequency components.  We complement this result with nearly matching lower bounds in the Statistical Query model. GD fits well in the SQ framework since each training step is determined by an expectation over the input distribution. We show that any SQ algorithm that achieves significant improvement over a constant function with queries of tolerance some inverse polynomial in the input dimensionality $n$ must use $n^{\\Omega(k)}$ queries even when the target functions are restricted to a set of $n^{O(k)}$ degree-$k$ polynomials, and the input distribution is uniform over the unit sphere; for this class the information-theoretic lower bound is only $\\Theta(k \\log n)$.  Our approach for both parts is based on spherical harmonics. We view gradient descent as an operator on the space of functions, and study its dynamics. An essential tool is the Funk-Hecke theorem, which explains the eigenfunctions of this operator in the case of the mean squared loss.",

Often, such distances are used in the context of variational problems, in which the statistician employs in place of an unknown measure a proxy constructed on the basis of independent samples. This raises the basic question of how well measures can be approximated in Wasserstein distance. While it is known that an empirical measure comprising i.i.d.¬†samples is rate-optimal for general measures, no improved results were known for measures possessing smooth densities. We prove the first minimax rates for estimation of smooth densities for general Wasserstein distances, thereby showing how the curse of dimensionality can be alleviated for sufficiently regular measures. We also show how to construct discretely supported measures, suitable for computational purposes, which enjoy improved rates. Our approach is based on novel bounds between the Wasserstein distances and suitable Besov norms, which may be of independent interest.",

The reversible case was addressed by Hsu et al. [2018+], who left the general case as an open problem. In the reversible case, the analysis is greatly facilitated by the fact that the Markov operator is self-adjoint, and Weyl‚Äôs inequality allows for a dimension-free perturbation analysis of the empirical eigenvalues. As Hsu et al. point out, in the absence of reversibility (and hence, the non-symmetry of the pair probabilities matrix), the existing perturbation analysis has a worst-case exponential dependence on the number of states $d$. Furthermore, even if an eigenvalue perturbation analysis with better dependence on $d$ were available, in the non-reversible case the connection between the spectral gap and the mixing time is not nearly as straightforward as in the reversible case. Our key insight is to estimate the pseudo-spectral gap instead, which allows us to overcome the loss of self-adjointness and to achieve a polynomial dependence on $d$ and the minimal stationary probability $\\pi_\\star$. Additionally, in the reversible case, we obtain simultaneous nearly (up to logarithmic factors) minimax rates in $t_{\\mathsf{mix}}$ and precision $\\varepsilon$, closing a gap in Hsu et al., who treated $\\varepsilon$ as constant in the lower bounds. Finally, we construct fully empirical confidence intervals for the pseudo-spectral gap, which shrink to zero at a rate of roughly $1/\\sqrt m$, and improve the state of the art in even the reversible case.",

In this paper, we make use of smoothness and strong convexity simultaneously to boost the convergence rate. Let $\\lambda$ be the modulus of strong convexity,  $\\kappa$ be the condition number, $F_*$ be the minimal risk, and $\\alpha>1$ be some small constant. First, we demonstrate that, in expectation, an $O(1/[\\lambda T^\\alpha] + \\kappa F_*/T)$ risk bound is attainable when $T = \\Omega(\\kappa^\\alpha)$. Thus, when $F_*$ is small, the convergence rate could be faster than $O(1/[\\lambda T])$ and approaches $O(1/[\\lambda T^\\alpha])$ in the ideal case. Second, to further benefit from small risk, we show that, in expectation, an $O(1/2^{T/\\kappa}+F_*)$ risk bound is achievable. Thus, the excess risk reduces exponentially until reaching $O(F_*)$, and if $F_*=0$, we obtain a global linear convergence. Finally, we emphasize that our proof is constructive and each risk bound is equipped with an efficient stochastic algorithm attaining that bound.",
