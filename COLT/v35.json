    "abstract": "We have observed an interesting, yet unexplained, phenomenon: Semidefinite programming (SDP) based relaxations of maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) tend to be tight in recovery problems with noisy data, even when MLE cannot exactly recover the ground truth. Several results establish tightness of SDP based relaxations in the regime where exact recovery from MLE is possible. However, to the best of our knowledge, their tightness is not understood beyond this regime. As an illustrative example, we focus on the generalized Procrustes problem.",

    "abstract": "In (Kégl, 2014), we recently showed empirically that AdaBoost.MH is one of the best multi-class boosting algorithms when the classical one-against-all base classifiers, proposed in the seminal paper of Schapire and Singer (1999), are replaced by factorized base classifiers containing a binary classifier and a vote (or code) vector. In a slightly different setup, a similar factorization coupled with an iterative optimization of the two factors also proved to be an excellent approach (Gao and Koller, 2011). The main algorithmic advantage of our approach over the original setup of Schapire and Singer (1999) is that trees can be built in a straightforward way by using the binary classifier at inner nodes. In this open problem paper we take a step back to the basic setup of boosting generic multi-class factorized (Hamming) classifiers (so no trees), and state the classical problem of boosting-like convergence of the training error. Given a vote vector, training the classifier leads to a standard weighted binary classification problem. The main difficulty of proving the convergence is that, unlike in binary AdaBoost, the sum of the weights in this weighted binary classification problem is less than one, which means that the lower bound on the edge, coming from the weak learning condition, shrinks. To show the convergence, we need a (uniform) lower bound on the sum of the weights in this derived binary classification problem.",

It is known that, under a popular continuous-time diffusion model, as long as the model parameters satisfy a natural incoherence condition, it is possible to recover the correct network structure with high probability if we observe O(d^3 \\log N) cascades, where d is the maximum number of parents of a node and N is the total number of nodes. However, the incoherence condition depends, in a non-trivial way, on the source (node) distribution of the cascades, which is typically unknown. Our open problem is whether it is possible to design an active algorithm which samples the source locations in a sequential manner and achieves the same or even better sample complexity, e.g., o(d_i^3 \\log N), than previous work.",

In this problem the learner is given random examples labeled by an unknown halfspace function f on \\mathbbR^n. Further f is r-sparse, that is it depends on at most r out of n variables. An attribute-efficient learning algorithm is an algorithm that can output a hypothesis close to f using a polynomial in r and \\log n number of examples (Blum, 1992). Despite a number of attempts and some partial progress, there are no efficient algorithms or hardness results for the problem. We propose a potentially easier question: what is the query complexity of this learning problem in the statistical query (SQ) model of Kearns (1998). We show that, as in the case of general PAC learning, the query complexity of attribute-efficient SQ learning of any concept class can be characterized by a combinatorial parameter of the concept class. The proposed question is then equivalent to estimating the value of this parameter for the concept class of halfspaces. A potentially simpler problem is to estimate this parameter for the concept class of decision lists, a subclass of halfspaces.",

In even relatively simple settings of this type, it is typically NP-hard to find the latent data which best explain some observations.  But do these complexity-theoretic obstructions actually prevent us from making good predictions?  Because each prediction depends on only a small number of variables, it might be possible to make good predictions without actually finding a good global assignment.  This may seem to be a purely technical distinction, but recent work has shown that several local prediction problems actually \\emphare easy even though the corresponding global inference problem is hard.

    "abstract": "A number of online algorithms have been developed that have small additional loss (regret) compared to the best “shifting expert”. In this model, there is a set of experts and the comparator is the best partition of the trial sequence into a small number of segments, where the expert of smallest loss is chosen in each segment. The regret is typically defined for worst-case data / loss sequences. There has been a recent surge of interest in online algorithms that combine good worst-case guarantees with much improved performance on easy data. A practically relevant class of easy data is the case when the loss of each expert is iid and the best and second best experts have a gap between their mean loss. In the full information setting, the FlipFlop algorithm by De Rooij et al. (2014) combines the best of the iid optimal Follow-The-Leader (FL) and the worst-case-safe Hedge algorithms, whereas in the bandit information case SAO by Bubeck and Slivkins (2012) competes with the iid optimal UCB and the worst-case-safe EXP3. We ask the same question for the shifting expert problem. First, we ask what are the simple and efficient algorithms for the shifting experts problem when the loss sequence in each segment is iid with respect to a fixed but unknown distribution. Second, we ask how to efficiently unite the performance of such algorithms on easy data with worst-case robustness. A particular intriguing open problem is the case when the comparator shifts within a small subset of experts from a large set under the assumption that the losses in each segment are iid.",

(2009), which captures learning tasks in which one type of error is costlier than other types. A positive reliable classifier is one that makes no false positive errors.  The goal in the \\emphpositive reliable agnostic framework is to output a hypothesis with the following properties: (i) its false positive error rate is at most ε, (ii) its false negative error rate is at most εmore than that of the best positive reliable classifier from the class.  A closely related notion is \\emphfully reliable agnostic learning, which considers \\emphpartial classifiers that are allowed to predict “unknown” on some inputs. The best fully reliable partial classifier is one that makes no errors and minimizes the probability of predicting “unknown”, and the goal in fully reliable learning is to output a hypothesis that is almost as good as the best fully reliable partial classifier from a class. For distribution-independent learning,  the best known algorithms for PAC learning typically utilize polynomial threshold representations, while the state of the art agnostic learning algorithms use point-wise polynomial approximations.  We show that \\emphone-sided polynomial approximations, an intermediate notion between polynomial threshold representations and point-wise polynomial approximations, suffice for learning in the reliable agnostic settings. We then show that majorities can be fully reliably learned and disjunctions of majorities can be positive reliably learned, through constructions of appropriate one-sided polynomial approximations.  Our fully reliable algorithm for majorities provides the first evidence that fully reliable learning may be strictly easier than agnostic learning.  Our algorithms also satisfy strong attribute-efficiency properties, and in many cases they provide smooth tradeoffs between sample complexity and running time.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider networks consisting of a finite number of non-overlapping communities. To extract these communities, the interaction between pairs of nodes may be sampled from a large available data set, which allows a given node pair to be sampled several times. When a node pair is sampled, the observed outcome is a binary random variable, equal to 1 if nodes interact and to 0 otherwise. The outcome is more likely to be positive if nodes belong to the same communities. For a given budget of node pair samples or observations, we wish to jointly design a sampling strategy (the sequence of sampled node pairs) and a clustering algorithm that recover the hidden communities with the highest possible accuracy. We consider both non-adaptive and adaptive sampling strategies, and for both classes of strategies, we derive fundamental performance limits satisfied by any sampling and clustering algorithm. In particular, we provide necessary conditions for the existence of algorithms recovering the communities accurately as the network size grows large. We also devise simple algorithms that accurately reconstruct the communities when this is at all possible, hence proving that the proposed necessary conditions for accurate community detection are also sufficient. The classical problem of community detection in the stochastic block model can be seen as a particular instance of the problems consider here. But our framework covers more general scenarios where the sequence of sampled node pairs can be designed in an adaptive manner. The paper provides new results for the stochastic block model, and extends the analysis to the case of adaptive sampling.",

These methods offer the currently best approach to several central problems such as learning half spaces and learning DNF’s. In addition they are widely used in numerous application domains. Despite their importance, there are still very few proof techniques to show limits on the power of these algorithms. We study the performance of this approach in the problem of (agnostically and improperly) learning halfspaces with margin γ. Let D be a distribution over labeled examples. The γ-margin error of a hyperplane h is the probability of an example to fall on the wrong side of h or at a distance \\leγfrom it. The γ-margin error of the best h is denoted \\mathrmErr_γ(D).

We give a complete answer to this question by giving a new analysis of the one-inclusion multiclass learner of Rubinstein et el (2006) showing that its sample complexity is essentially optimal. Then, we turn to study the popular hypothesis class of generalized linear classifiers. We derive optimal learners that, unlike the one-inclusion algorithm, are computationally efficient. Furthermore, we show that the sample complexity of these learners is better than the sample complexity of the ERM rule, thus settling in negative an open question due to Collins (2005)",

This policy generalizes the celebrated “probability matching” heuristic which has been experimentally and widely observed in human decision making. However, despite its ubiquity, the Thompson Sampling policy is poorly understood. Our goal in this paper is to make progress towards understanding the empirical success of this policy. We proceed using the lens of approximation algorithms and problem definitions from stochastic optimization. We focus on an objective function termed \\em stochastic regret that captures the expected number of times the policy plays an arm that is not the eventual best arm, where the expectation is over the prior distribution. Given such a definition, we show that TS is a 2–approximation to the optimal decision policy in two extreme but canonical scenarios. One such scenario is the two-armed bandit problem which is used as a calibration point in all bandit literature. The second scenario is stochastic optimization where the outcome of a random variable is revealed in a single play to a high or low deterministic value. We show that the 2 approximation is tight in both these scenarios. We provide an uniform analysis framework that in theory is capable of proving our  conjecture that the TS policy is a 2–approximation to the optimal decision policy for minimizing stochastic regret, for any prior distribution and any time horizon.",

    "abstract": "The paper proposes a novel upper confidence bound (UCB) procedure for identifying the arm with the largest mean in a multi-armed bandit game in the fixed confidence setting using a small number of total samples.  The procedure cannot be improved in the sense that the number of samples required to identify the best arm is within a constant factor of a lower bound based on the law of the iterated logarithm (LIL). Inspired by the LIL, we construct our confidence bounds to explicitly account for the infinite time horizon of the algorithm. In addition, by using a novel stopping time for the algorithm we avoid a union bound over the arms that has been observed in other UCB-type algorithms. We prove that the algorithm is optimal up to constants and also show through simulations that it provides superior performance with respect to the state-of-the-art.",

That is, the labeling function is deterministic, but not necessarily a member of some known  hypothesis class. However, agnostic learning of deterministic labels has so far received little research attention. We investigate this setting and show that it displays a behavior that is quite different from that of the fundamental results of the common (PAC) learning setups. First, we show that the sample complexity of learning a binary hypothesis class (with respect to deterministic labeling functions) is not fully determined by the VC-dimension of the class. For any d, we present classes of VC-dimension d that are learnable from \\tilde O(d/ε)-many samples and classes that require samples of size Ω(d/ε^2). Furthermore, we show that in this setup, there are classes for which any proper learner has suboptimal sample complexity.  While the class can be learned with sample complexity \\tilde O(d/ε), any \\emphproper (and therefore, any ERM) algorithm requires Ω(d/ε^2) samples. We provide combinatorial characterizations of both phenomena, and further analyze the utility of unlabeled samples in this setting. Lastly, we discuss the error rates of nearest neighbor algorithms under deterministic labels and additional niceness-of-data assumptions.",

Alternatively, coverage functions can be described as non-negative linear combinations of monotone disjunctions. They are a natural subclass of submodular functions and arise in a number of applications. We give an algorithm that for any γ,δ>0, given random and uniform examples of an unknown coverage function c, finds a function h that approximates c within factor 1+γon all but δ-fraction of the points in time poly(n,1/γ,1/δ). This is the first fully-polynomial algorithm for learning an interesting class of functions in the demanding PMAC model of Balcan and Harvey (2011). Our algorithms are based on several new structural properties of coverage functions. Using the results in (Feldman and Kothari, 2014), we also show that coverage functions are learnable agnostically with excess \\ell_1-error εover all product and symmetric distributions in time n^\\log(1/ε).

Important recent results show that the problem can be solved efficiently under the assumption that the unknown matrix is incoherent and the subsample is drawn uniformly at random. Are these assumptions necessary? It is well known that Matrix Completion in its full generality is NP-hard. However, little is known if we make additional assumptions such as incoherence and permit the algorithm to output a matrix of slightly higher rank. In this paper we prove that Matrix Completion remains computationally intractable even if the unknown matrix has rank 4 but we are allowed to output any constant rank matrix, and even if additionally we assume that the unknown  matrix is incoherent and are shown 90% of the entries. This result relies on the conjectured hardness of the 4-Coloring problem. We also consider the positive semidefinite Matrix Completion problem. Here we show a similar hardness result under the standard assumption that \\mathrmP\\ne \\mathrmNP. Our results greatly narrow the gap between existing feasibility results and computational lower bounds. In particular, we believe that our results give the first complexity-theoretic justification for why distributional assumptions are needed beyond the incoherence assumption in order to obtain positive results. On the technical side, we contribute several new ideas on how to encode hard combinatorial problems in low-rank optimization problems.

Kruskal’s theorem has found many applications in proving the identifiability of parameters for various latent variable models and mixture models such as Hidden Markov models, topic models etc. Our robust version immediately implies identifiability using only polynomially many samples in many of these settings – an essential first step towards efficient learning algorithms.

This is a central notion in signal processing, statistics and machine learning.

In most settings, A is \\em overcomplete: it has more columns than rows. This paper presents a polynomial-time algorithm for learning overcomplete dictionaries; the only previously known algorithm with provable guarantees is the recent work of Spielman et al.

Our algorithm applies to \\em incoherent dictionaries which have been a central object of study since they were introduced in seminal work of Donoho and Huo (1999). In particular, a dictionary is μ-incoherent if each pair of columns has inner product at most μ/ \\sqrtn.

In this paper, we introduce a polynomial time/sample complexity  method for learning a mixture of r discrete product distributions over {1, 2, …, \\ell}^n, for  general \\ell and r.

The main challenge in learning mixtures of discrete product distributions is that  the corresponding low-rank tensors cannot be obtained directly from the sample moments. Instead, we need to estimate a low-rank matrix using only off-diagonal entries, and estimate a tensor using a few linear measurements.

In this paper, we consider the question of statistical consistency of such methods. We focus on settings where the binary problems are solved by minimizing a binary surrogate loss, and derive general conditions on the binary surrogate loss under which the one-vs-all and all-pairs code matrices yield consistent algorithms with respect to the multiclass 0-1 loss. We then consider general multiclass learning problems defined by a general multiclass loss, and derive conditions on the output code matrix and binary surrogates under which the resulting algorithm is consistent with respect to the target multiclass loss. We also consider \\emphprobabilistic code matrices, where one reduces a multiclass problem to a set of \\emphclass probability labeled binary problems, and show that these can yield benefits in the sense of requiring a smaller number of binary problems to achieve overall consistency. Our analysis makes interesting connections with the theory of proper composite losses (Buja et al., 2005; Reid and Williamson, 2010); these play a role in constructing the right ‘decoding’ for converting the predictions on the binary problems to the final multiclass prediction.

Over the course of many trials, the goal of the learning algorithm is to achieve small additional loss (i.e. regret) compared to the loss of the best from a set of K experts. The two most popular algorithms are Hedge/Weighted Majority and Follow the Perturbed Leader (FPL). The latter algorithm first perturbs the loss of each expert by independent additive noise drawn from a fixed distribution, and then predicts with the expert of minimum perturbed loss (“the leader”) where ties are broken uniformly at random. To achieve the optimal worst-case regret as a function of the loss L^* of the best expert in hindsight, the two types of algorithms need to tune their learning rate or noise magnitude, respectively, as a function of L^*. Instead of perturbing the losses of the experts with additive noise, we randomly set them to 0 or 1 before selecting the leader. We show that our perturbations are an instance of dropout — because experts may be interpreted as features — although for non-binary losses the dropout probability needs to be made dependent on the losses to get good regret bounds. We show that this simple, tuning-free version of the FPL algorithm achieves two feats: optimal worst-case O(\\sqrtL^* \\ln K + \\ln K) regret as a function of L^*, and optimal O(\\ln K) regret when the loss vectors are drawn i.i.d. from a fixed distribution and there is a gap between the expected loss of the best expert and all others. A number of recent algorithms from the Hedge family (AdaHedge and FlipFlop) also achieve this, but they employ sophisticated tuning regimes. The dropout perturbation of the losses of the experts result in different noise distributions for each expert (because they depend on the expert’s total loss) and curiously enough no additional tuning is needed: the choice of dropout probability only affects the constants.",

Sample complexity of private PAC and agnostic learning was studied in a number of prior works starting with (Kasiviswanathan et al., 2008) but a number of basic questions still remain open (Beimel et al. 2010; Chaudhuri and Hsu, 2011; Beimel et al., 2013a,b). Our main contribution is an equivalence between the sample complexity of differentially-private learning of a concept class C (or \\mathrmSCDP(C)) and the randomized one-way communication complexity of the evaluation problem for concepts from C. Using this equivalence we prove the following bounds: \\beginitemize \\item \\mathrmSCDP(C) = Ω(\\mathrmLDim(C)), where \\mathrmLDim(C) is the Littlestone’s (1987) dimension characterizing the number of mistakes in the online-mistake-bound learning model.

    "abstract": "We consider algorithmic problems in the setting in which the input data has been partitioned arbitrarily on many servers. The goal is to compute a function of all the data, and the bottleneck is the communication used by the algorithm. We present algorithms for two illustrative problems on massive data sets: (1) computing a low-rank approximation of a matrix A=A^1 + A^2 + \\ldots + A^s, with matrix A^t stored on server t and (2) computing a function of a vector a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_s, where server t has the vector a_t; this includes the well-studied special case of computing frequency moments and separable functions, as well as higher-order correlations such as the number of subgraphs of a specified type occurring in a graph. For both problems we give algorithms with nearly optimal communication, and in particular the only dependence on n, the size of the data, is in the number of bits needed to represent indices and words (O(\\log n)).",

    "abstract": "Compressed sensing (sparse signal recovery) has been a popular and important research topic in recent years. By observing that natural signals  (e.g., images or network data) are often nonnegative, we propose a framework for nonnegative signal recovery using \\em Compressed Counting (CC). CC is a technique built on  \\em maximally-skewed α-stable random projections originally developed for data stream computations (e.g., entropy estimations).  Our recovery procedure is computationally efficient in that it requires only one linear scan of the coordinates. In our settings, the signal \\mathbfx∈\\mathbbR^N is assumed to be nonnegative, i.e., x_i≥0, ∀i. We prove that, when α∈(0, 0.5], it suffices to use  M=(C_α+o(1)) ε^-α \\left(\\sum_i=1^N x_i^α\\right)\\log N/δmeasurements so that, with probability 1-δ, all coordinates will be recovered within εadditive precision, in one scan of the coordinates. The constant C_α=1 when α\\rightarrow0 and C_α=\\pi/2 when α=0.5. In particular, when α\\rightarrow0, the required number of measurements is essentially M=K\\log N/δ, where K = \\sum_i=1^N 1{x_i≠0} is the number of nonzero coordinates of the signal.",

    "abstract": "Loss functions are central to machine learning because they are the means by which the quality of a prediction is evaluated. Any loss that is not proper, or can not be transformed to be proper via a link function is inadmissible. All admissible losses for n-class problems can be obtained in terms of a convex body in \\mathbbR^n.  We show this explicitly and show how some existing results simplify when viewed from this perspective.  This  allows the development of a rich algebra of losses induced by binary operations on convex bodies (that return a convex body).  Furthermore it allows us to define an “inverse loss” which provides a universal “substitution function” for the Aggregating Algorithm.  In doing so we show a formal connection between proper losses and norms.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we show that very large mixtures of Gaussians are efficiently learnable in high dimension. More precisely, we prove that a mixture with known identical covariance matrices whose number of components is a polynomial of any fixed degree in the dimension n is polynomially learnable as long as a certain non-degeneracy condition on the means is satisfied. It turns out that this condition is generic in the sense of smoothed complexity, as soon as the dimensionality of the space is high enough. Moreover, we prove that no such condition can possibly exist in low dimension and the problem of learning the parameters is generically hard.  In contrast, much of the existing work on Gaussian Mixtures relies on low-dimensional projections and thus hits an artificial barrier. Our main result on mixture recovery relies on a new “Poissonization\"-based technique, which transforms a mixture of Gaussians to a linear map of a product distribution. The problem of learning this map can be efficiently solved using some recent results on tensor decompositions and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), thus giving an  algorithm for recovering the mixture. In addition, we combine our low-dimensional hardness results for Gaussian mixtures with  Poissonization to show how to embed difficult instances of low-dimensional Gaussian mixtures into the ICA setting, thus establishing exponential information-theoretic lower bounds for underdetermined ICA in low dimension. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such result  in the literature. In addition to contributing to  the problem of Gaussian mixture learning, we believe that this work is among the first steps toward better understanding the rare phenomenon of the “blessing of dimensionality\" in the computational aspects of statistical inference.",

    "header": "Near-Optimal Herding",
    "abstract": "Herding is an algorithm of recent interest in the machine learning community, motivated by inference in Markov random fields. It solves the following sampling problem: given a set \\mathcalX ⊂\\mathbbR^d with mean μ, construct an infinite sequence of points from \\mathcalX such that, for every t ≥1, the mean of the first t points in that sequence lies within Euclidean distance O(1/t) of μ. The classic Perceptron boundedness theorem implies that such a result actually holds for a wide class of algorithms, although the factors suppressed by the O(1/t) notation are exponential in d. Thus, to establish a non-trivial result for the sampling problem, one must carefully analyze the factors suppressed by the O(1/t) error bound. This paper studies the best error that can be achieved for the sampling problem. Known analysis of the Herding algorithm give an error bound that depends on geometric properties of \\mathcalX but, even under favorable conditions, this bound depends linearly on d. We present a new polynomial-time algorithm that solves the sampling problem with error O\\left(\\sqrtd \\log^2.5|\\mathcalX| / t \\right) assuming that \\mathcalX is finite. Our algorithm is based on recent algorithmic results in \\textitdiscrepancy theory. We also show that any algorithm for the sampling problem must have error Ω( \\sqrtd / t ). This implies that our algorithm is optimal to within logarithmic factors.",

Given \\tildeO(1/\\varepsilon^2) samples from an unknown mixture, our algorithm outputs a mixture that is \\varepsilon-close in total variation distance, in time \\tildeO(1/\\varepsilon^5). Our sample complexity is optimal up to logarithmic factors, and significantly improves upon both Kalai et al., whose algorithm has a prohibitive dependence on 1/\\varepsilon, and Feldman et al., whose algorithm requires bounds on the mixture parameters and depends pseudo-polynomially in these parameters. One of our main contributions is an improved and generalized algorithm for selecting a good candidate distribution from among competing hypotheses. Namely, given a collection of N hypotheses containing at least one candidate that is \\varepsilon-close to an unknown distribution, our algorithm outputs a candidate which is O(\\varepsilon)-close to the  distribution. The algorithm requires O(\\logN/\\varepsilon^2) samples from the unknown distribution and O(N \\log N/\\varepsilon^2) time, which improves previous such results (such as the Scheffé estimator) from a quadratic dependence of the running time on N to quasilinear. Given the wide use of such results for the purpose of hypothesis selection, our improved algorithm implies immediate improvements to any such use.",

In the frequently encountered situation when sequential entropy and i.i.d. empirical entropy match, our results point to the interesting phenomenon that the rates for statistical learning with squared loss and online nonparametric regression are the same. In addition to a non-algorithmic study of minimax regret, we exhibit a generic forecaster that enjoys the established optimal rates.
