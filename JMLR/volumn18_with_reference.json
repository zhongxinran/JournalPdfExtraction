Local changes are desirable because in practice edits of other parts of the clustering are considered churn - changes that are perceived as quality-neutral or quality-negative.

Other feedback models  Besides the cluster split/merge feedback considered here, two other kinds of feedback have also been studied in the literature: cluster-assignment feedback (Basu et al., 2002; Nie et al., 2012) and must-link/cannot-link feedback (Basu et al., 2004; Ashtiani et al., 2016). The former reveals the ground-truth cluster assignment of a single data point; the latter reveals whether or not a pair of points are in the same ground-truth cluster.  Claim 28 Cluster-assignment feedback and must-link/cannot link feedback can be converted to cluster split/merge feedback in the unrestricted-merge model.  Proof We \ufb01rst observe that cluster-assignment feedback can be converted to must-link/cannot-link feedback as follows. For every two known cluster assignments for points x and y s.t. x and y belong to the same ground-truth cluster, output a must-link feedback for (x, y). For every two known cluster assignments for points x and y s.t. x and y belong to different ground-truth clusters, output a cannot-link feedback for (x, y).  We next observe that must-link/cannot-link feedback can be converted to cluster split/merge feedback in the unrestricted merge model as follows. For every must-link feedback for points x and y, if x and y belong to different clusters in the proposed clustering, request to merge these two clus- ters. For every cannot-link feedback for points x and y, if x and y belong to the same cluster in the proposed clustering, request to split this cluster. Observe that by de\ufb01nition, the output split/merge requests satisfy the assumptions of the unrestricted-merge model.  However, the conversion in Claim 28 is sometimes vacuous: cluster split/merge feedback is only output when the cluster-assignment or must-link/cannot-link feedback disagrees with the current clustering. Still, it is reasonable to assume that while the proposed clustering is not equivalent to the ground truth, a constant fraction of such feedback will disagree with the proposed clustering.

Experiments with robust average-linkage tree  When we investigate instances where our algorithms are unable to \ufb01nd the target clustering, we observe that there are outlier points that are attached near the root of the average-linkage tree, which are incorrectly split off and re-merged by the algorithm without making any progress towards \ufb01nding the target clustering.  We can address these outliers by constructing the average-linkage tree in a more robust way: \ufb01rst \ufb01nd groups (\u201cblobs\u201d) of similar points of some minimum size, compute an average-linkage tree for each group, and then combine these trees using average-linkage. The tree constructed in such fashion may then be used by our algorithms.  We tried this approach, using Algorithm 2 from Balcan and Gupta (2010) to compute the blobs. We \ufb01nd that using the robust average-linkage tree gives better performance for the unpruned data sets, but gives no gains for the pruned data sets, as expected. Figure 15 displays the comparison in the unrestricted merge model for the \ufb01ve unpruned data sets. For the pruned data sets, we expect the robust tree to be very similar to the standard tree, which explains why there is little difference in performance (results not shown).

The inverse covariance matrix \u03c7\u22121 is, in the basis where variational parameters are beliefs q, a linear function of \u03bb. Updating a single \u03bb can be achieved by the Shermann-Morrison formula, which in its linearized form becomes  \u03c7i,i \u03b4\u03bbi,j \u03c7j,j = (C\u2217  i,j \u2212 \u03c7i,j) .  (29)  It is also possible to write a similar expression blockwise (over \u03bb\u03b1). This scheme and variations were considered, but were found to require more iterations or stronger damping (for convergence) than the linearized cavity formula (20).  In our approach we associate each constraint to a unique region, but some statistics such as Vp(xi, xi) may be approximated by di\ufb00erent \u03b1 for the same variational approach (for example by qij or qik if i participates in two interactions). Though these estimates agree \ufb01nally at the solution point, they disagree at intermediate stages of CLBP. Since updates for \u03bb may be correlated (consider Figure 8 where diagonal and o\ufb00-diagonal are strongly anti-correlated), the grouping of \u03bb may be very important. Updating non-disjoint sets and averaging over results may be more stable than our scheme where closely correlated \u03bb (for example \u03bbi,i and \u03bbi,j) may be updated on di\ufb00erent regions.

To understand the success and limitations of RNNs, it is critical that we advance our analysis of their fundamental memory properties. We focus on echo state networks (ESNs), which are RNNs with simple memoryless nodes and random connectivity. In most existing analyses, the short-term memory (STM) capacity results conclude that the ESN network size must scale linearly with the input size for unstructured inputs. The main contribution of this paper is to provide general results characterizing the STM capacity for linear ESNs with multidimensional input streams when the inputs have common low- dimensional structure: sparsity in a basis or significant statistical dependence between inputs. In both cases, we show that the number of nodes in the network must scale linearly with the information rate and poly-logarithmically with the input dimension. The analysis relies on advanced applications of random matrix theory and results in explicit non-asymptotic bounds on the recovery error. Taken together, this analysis provides a significant step forward in our understanding of the STM properties in RNNs.", "pdf_url": "http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-270/16-270.pdf", "reference": "M.

Each summand is then bounded by the maximum of these two quantities with probability 1 \u2212 O(|\u0393k|(LN )\u2212\u03b2), the |\u0393k| term coming from the union bound over all terms in each inner sum.  Using this bound on each summand, we obtain the total bound by taking a union bound, sum-  ming over l \u2208 [1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , L], and dividing by R, yielding a bound of the maximum of  t\u03c32  X \u2264 c\u03b2\u03ba  \u00b52  k\u22121  + 2L\u00b54 0  log(LN ),  R M  (cid:18) N M  (cid:19)  and  t2U 2  \u03b1 log2  (cid:19)  (cid:18) |\u0393k|U 2 \u03b1 \u03c32 X  \u2264 \u03b22c\u03ba2 R  M 2 \u00b52  k\u22121  (cid:18) N M  (cid:19)  + 2RL\u00b52 0  log4 (LN ) ,  with probability 1 \u2212 O(M (N L)\u2212\u03b2). To complete the proof, we note that if we have  M \u2265 c\u03b2\u03baR (cid:0)N + L\u00b52 0  (cid:1) log2(LN ),  then both terms in this bound are less than \u00b52  k\u22121.  References  M.

One such tool is persistent homology, which provides a multiscale description of the homological features within a data set. A useful representation of this homological information is a  persistence diagram  (PD). Efforts have been made to map PDs into spaces with additional structure valuable to machine learning tasks. We convert a PD to a finite- dimensional vector representation which we call a  persistence image  (PI), and prove the stability of this transformation with respect to small perturbations in the inputs. The discriminatory power of PIs is compared against existing methods, showing significant performance gains. We explore the use of PIs with vector-based machine learning tools, such as linear sparse support vector machines, which identify features containing discriminating topological information. Finally, high accuracy inference of parameter values from the dynamic output of a discrete dynamical system (the  linked twist map ) and a partial differential equation (the  anisotropic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation ) provide a novel application of the discriminatory power of PIs.", "pdf_url": "http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-337/16-337.pdf", "reference": "Aaron Adcock, Erik Carlsson, and Gunnar Carlsson.

We also derive non- asymptotic bounds for an averaged version. Our results cover both the cases of biased and unbiased Monte Carlo approximation. To support our findings, we discuss the inference of a sparse generalized linear model with random effect and the problem of learning the edge structure and parameters of sparse undirected graphical models.", "pdf_url": "http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/15-038/15-038.pdf", "reference": "S.

It becomes possible to store a large number of temporal patterns in a single recurrent neural network. In the recall process, stored patterns can be morphed and  focussed . Parametric families of patterns can be learnt from a very small number of examples. Stored temporal patterns can be content- addressed in ways that are analog to recalling static patterns in Hopfield networks.

In Proceedings of Parallel Problem  59   Information-Geometric Optimization  \ud835\udf15\ud835\udc56 ln \ud835\udc43\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc65). So the covariance matrix of \u02dc\u2207 ln \ud835\udc43\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc65) is E\ud835\udc65\u223c\ud835\udc43\ud835\udf03 (\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc56 ln \ud835\udc43\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc57 ln \ud835\udc43\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc65)), which is equal to the Fisher matrix by definition. So this covariance matrix is the identity, whose largest eigenvalue is 1. This proves Proposition 20.  For Corollary 21, by the relationship (2) between Fisher matrix and Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence, if \ud835\udc63 is the speed of the IGO flow then the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence between \ud835\udc43\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc61 and \ud835\udc43\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc61+\ud835\udeff\ud835\udc61 (where \ud835\udc43\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc61+\ud835\udeff\ud835\udc61 is the trajectory of the IGO flow after a time \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc61) is equal to the square norm of \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc61.\ud835\udc63 in Fisher metric up to an \ud835\udc42(\u2016\ud835\udeff\ud835\udc61.\ud835\udc63\u20163) term. Now if \ud835\udc43\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc61+\ud835\udeff\ud835\udc61 is obtained by a finite-population IGO algorithm, by Theorem 6 the actual \ud835\udc63 from the IGO algorithm differs from the speed of the IGO flow by an \ud835\udc5c(1)\ud835\udc41 \u2192\u221e term. Collecting terms, we find the expression in Corollary 21.  D.7 Proof of Proposition 22 (Noisy IGO)  On the one hand, let \ud835\udc43\ud835\udf03 be a family of distributions on \ud835\udc4b. The IGO algorithm (16) applied to a random function \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc65) = \u02dc\ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udf14) where \ud835\udf14 is a random variable uniformly distributed in [0, 1] reads  \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc61+\ud835\udeff\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc61  ^\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56 \u0303\ufe00\u2207\ud835\udf03 ln \ud835\udc43\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56)  \ud835\udc41 \u2211\ufe01  (77)  \ud835\udc56=1 where \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 \u223c \ud835\udc43\ud835\udf03 and ^\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56 is according to (14) where ranking is applied to the values \u02dc\ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udf14\ud835\udc56), with \ud835\udf14\ud835\udc56 uniform variables in [0, 1] independent from \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 and from each other.  On the other hand, for the IGO algorithm using \ud835\udc43\ud835\udf03 \u2297\ud835\udc48[0,1] and applied to the deterministic function \u02dc\ud835\udc53 , ^\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56 is computed using the ranking according to the \u02dc\ud835\udc53 values of the sampled points \u02dc\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 = (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udf14\ud835\udc56), and thus coincides with the one in (77).  Besides,  \ud835\udf15\ud835\udf03 ln \ud835\udc43\ud835\udf03\u2297\ud835\udc48[0,1](\u02dc\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56) = \ud835\udf15\ud835\udf03 ln \ud835\udc43\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56) + \ud835\udf15\ud835\udf03 ln \ud835\udc48[0,1](\ud835\udf14\ud835\udc56)    \u23df   \u23de =0  and thus, both the vanilla gradients and the Fisher matrix \ud835\udc3c (given by the tensor square of the vanilla gradients) coincide. This proves that the IGO algorithm update on space \ud835\udc4b \u00d7 [0, 1], using the family of distributions \u02dc\ud835\udc43\ud835\udf03 = \ud835\udc43\ud835\udf03 \u2297 \ud835\udc48[0,1], applied to the deterministic function \u02dc\ud835\udc53 , coincides with (77).

By letting the number of hidden units grow unbounded and using classical non-Euclidean regularization tools on the output weights, they lead to a convex optimization problem and we provide a detailed theoretical analysis of their generalization performance, with a study of both the approximation and the estimation errors. We show in particular that they are adaptive to unknown underlying linear structures, such as the dependence on the projection of the input variables onto a low-dimensional subspace. Moreover, when using sparsity- inducing norms on the input weights, we show that high- dimensional non-linear variable selection may be achieved, without any strong assumption regarding the data and with a total number of variables potentially exponential in the number of observations. However, solving this convex optimization problem in infinite dimensions is only possible if the non- convex subproblem of addition of a new unit can be solved efficiently. We provide a simple geometric interpretation for our choice of activation functions and describe simple conditions for convex relaxations of the finite-dimensional non- convex subproblem to achieve the same generalization error bounds, even when constant-factor approximations cannot be found. We were not able to find strong enough convex relaxations to obtain provably polynomial-time algorithms and leave open the existence or non-existence of such tractable algorithms with non-exponential sample complexities.", "pdf_url": "http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/14-546/14-546.pdf", "reference": "P.-A.

We provide a theoretical analysis of the number of required samples for a given approximation error, leading to both upper and lower bounds that are based solely on the eigenvalues of the associated integral operator and match up to logarithmic terms. In particular, we show that the upper bound may be obtained from independent and identically distributed samples from a specific non-uniform distribution, while the lower bound if valid for any set of points. Applying our results to kernel-based quadrature, while our results are fairly general, we recover known upper and lower bounds for the special cases of Sobolev spaces. Moreover, our results extend to the more general problem of full function approximations (beyond simply computing an integral), with results in $L_2$- and $L_\\infty$-norm that match known results for special cases. Applying our results to random features, we show an improvement of the number of random features needed to preserve the generalization guarantees for learning with Lipshitz-continuous losses.", "pdf_url": "http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/15-178/15-178.pdf", "reference": "R.

Finding the CP decomposition of an overcomplete tensor is NP-hard in general. We consider the case where the tensor components are randomly drawn, and show that the simple power iteration recovers the components with bounded error under mild initialization conditions. We apply our analysis to unsupervised learning of latent variable models, such as multi-view mixture models and spherical Gaussian mixtures. Given the third order moment tensor, we learn the parameters using tensor power iterations. We prove it can correctly learn the model parameters when the number of hidden components $k$ is much larger than the data dimension $d$, up to $k = o(d^{1.5})$. We initialize the power iterations with data samples and prove its success under mild conditions on the signal-to-noise ratio of the samples. Our analysis significantly expands the class of latent variable models where spectral methods are applicable. Our analysis also deals with noise in the input tensor leading to sample complexity result in the application to learning latent variable models.", "pdf_url": "http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/15-486/15-486.pdf", "reference": "A.

This algorithm relies on a flexible split-merge procedure built using the particle Gibbs sampler introduced in Andrieu et al. (2009, 2010). The resulting so-called Particle Gibbs Split-Merge sampler does not require the computation of a complex acceptance ratio and can be implemented using existing sequential Monte Carlo libraries. We investigate its performance experimentally on synthetic problems as well as on geolocation data. Our results show that for a given computational budget, the Particle Gibbs Split-Merge sampler empirically outperforms existing split merge methods.

In this paper, we revisit the classical rank-constrained FA problem which seeks to approximate an observed covariance matrix ($\\B\\Sigma$) by the sum of a Positive Semidefinite (PSD) low-rank component ($\\B\\Theta$) and a diagonal matrix ($\\B\\Phi$) (with nonnegative entries) subject to $\\B\\Sigma - \\B\\Phi$ being PSD. We propose a flexible family of rank-constrained, nonlinear Semidefinite Optimization based formulations for this task. We introduce a reformulation of the problem as a smooth optimization problem with convex, compact constraints and propose a unified algorithmic framework, utilizing state of the art techniques in nonlinear optimization to obtain high-quality feasible solutions for our proposed formulation. At the same time, by using a variety of techniques from discrete and global optimization, we show that these solutions are  certifiably optimal  in many cases, even for problems with thousands of variables. Our techniques are general and make  no  assumption on the underlying problem data. The estimator proposed herein aids statistical interpretability and provides computational scalability and significantly improved accuracy when compared to current, publicly available popular methods for rank-constrained FA. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal on an array of synthetic and real-life datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first paper that demonstrates how a previously intractable rank-constrained optimization problem can be solved to provable optimality by coupling developments in convex analysis and in global and discrete optimization.", "pdf_url": "http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/15-613/15-613.pdf"}, "Group Sparse Optimization via lp,q Regularization": {"volumn": 18, "url": "http://jmlr.org/papers/v18/15-651.html", "header": "Group Sparse Optimization via lp,q Regularization", "author": "Yaohua Hu, Chong Li, Kaiwen Meng, Jing Qin, Xiaoqi Yang", "time": "18(30):1\u221252, 2017.", "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate a group sparse optimization problem via $\\ell_{p,q}$ regularization in three aspects: theory, algorithm and application. In the theoretical aspect, by introducing a notion of group restricted eigenvalue condition, we establish an oracle property and a global recovery bound of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\lambda^\\frac{2}{2-q})$ for any point in a level set of the $\\ell_{p,q}$ regularization problem, and by virtue of modern variational analysis techniques, we also provide a local analysis of recovery bound of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\lambda^2)$ for a path of local minima. In the algorithmic aspect, we apply the well-known proximal gradient method to solve the $\\ell_{p,q}$ regularization problems, either by analytically solving some specific $\\ell_{p,q}$ regularization subproblems, or by using the Newton method to solve general $\\ell_{p,q}$ regularization subproblems. In particular, we establish a local linear convergence rate of the proximal gradient method for solving the $\\ell_{1,q}$ regularization problem under some mild conditions and by first proving a second-order growth condition. As a consequence, the local linear convergence rate of proximal gradient method for solving the usual $\\ell_{q}$ regularization problem ($0<q<1$) is obtained. Finally in the aspect of application, we present some numerical results on both the simulated data and the real data in gene transcriptional regulation.", "pdf_url": "http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/15-651/15-651.pdf"}, "Online Bayesian Passive-Aggressive Learning": {"volumn": 18, "url": "http://jmlr.org/papers/v18/14-188.html", "header": "Online Bayesian Passive-Aggressive Learning", "author": "Tianlin Shi, Jun Zhu", "time": "18(33):1\u221239, 2017.", "abstract": "We present online Bayesian Passive-Aggressive (BayesPA) learning, a generic online learning framework for hierarchical Bayesian models with max-margin posterior regularization.

As an important example, we apply BayesPA to topic modeling and derive efficient online learning algorithms for max-margin topic models. We further develop nonparametric BayesPA topic models to infer the unknown number of topics in an online manner.

In this paper, we introduce a novel spectral algorithm to perform inference in HSMMs. Unlike expectation maximization (EM), our approach correctly estimates the probability of given observation sequence based on a set of training sequences. Our approach is based on estimating moments from the sample, whose number of dimensions depends only logarithmically on the maximum length of the hidden state persistence. Moreover, the algorithm requires only a few matrix inversions and is therefore computationally efficient. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real data demonstrate the advantage of the algorithm over EM in terms of speed and accuracy, especially for large data sets.", "pdf_url": "http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/15-468/15-468.pdf"}, "Bridging Supervised Learning and Test-Based Co-optimization": {"volumn": 18, "url": "http://jmlr.org/papers/v18/16-223.html", "header": "Bridging Supervised Learning and Test-Based Co-optimization", "author": "Elena Popovici", "time": "18(38):1\u221239, 2017.", "abstract": "This paper takes a close look at the important commonalities and subtle differences between the well-established field of supervised learning and the much younger one of co-optimization.

This ordering can often induce local dependence among nearby variables. However, in complex data, the width of this dependence may vary, making simple assumptions such as a constant neighborhood size unrealistic. We propose a framework for learning this local dependence based on estimating the inverse of the Cholesky factor of the covariance matrix. Penalized maximum likelihood estimation of this matrix yields a simple regression interpretation for local dependence in which variables are predicted by their neighbors. Our proposed method involves solving a convex, penalized Gaussian likelihood problem with a hierarchical group lasso penalty. The problem decomposes into independent subproblems which can be solved efficiently in parallel using first-order methods. Our method yields a sparse, symmetric, positive definite estimator of the precision matrix, encoding a Gaussian graphical model. We derive theoretical results not found in existing methods attaining this structure. In particular, our conditions for signed support recovery and estimation consistency rates in multiple norms are as mild as those in a regression problem. Empirical results show our method performing favorably compared to existing methods. We apply our method to genomic data to flexibly model linkage disequilibrium. Our method is also applied to improve the performance of discriminant analysis in sound recording classification.", "pdf_url": "http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-198/16-198.pdf"}}
