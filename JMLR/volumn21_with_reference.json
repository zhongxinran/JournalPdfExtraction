Neely", "time": "21(1):1\u221224, 2020.", "abstract": "This paper considers online convex optimization over a complicated constraint set, which typically consists of multiple functional constraints and a set constraint.  The conventional online projection algorithm (Zinkevich, 2003) can be difficult to implement due to the potentially high computation complexity of the projection operation. In this paper, we relax the functional constraints by allowing them to be violated at each round but still requiring them to be satisfied in the long term. This type of relaxed online convex optimization (with long term constraints) was first considered in Mahdavi et al. (2012). That prior work proposes an algorithm to achieve $O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret and $O(T^{3/4})$ constraint violations for general problems and another algorithm to achieve an $O(T^{2/3})$ bound for both regret and constraint violations when the constraint set can be described by a finite number of linear constraints.  A recent extension in Jenatton et al. (2016) can achieve $O(T^{\\max\\{\\theta,1-\\theta\\}})$ regret and $O(T^{1-\\theta/2})$ constraint violations where $\\theta\\in (0,1)$. The current paper proposes a new simple algorithm that yields improved performance in comparison to prior works. The new algorithm achieves an $O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret bound with $O(1)$ constraint violations.", "pdf_url": "http://jmlr.org/papers/volume21/16-494/16-494.pdf"}, "A Statistical Learning Approach to Modal Regression": {"volumn": 21, "url": "http://jmlr.org/papers/v21/17-068.html", "header": "A Statistical Learning Approach to Modal Regression", "author": "Yunlong Feng, Jun Fan, Johan A.K. Suykens", "time": "21(2):1\u221235, 2020.", "abstract": "This paper studies the nonparametric modal regression problem systematically from a statistical learning viewpoint.  Originally motivated by pursuing a theoretical understanding of the maximum correntropy criterion based regression (MCCR), our study reveals that MCCR with a tending-to-zero scale parameter is essentially modal regression. We show that the nonparametric modal regression problem can be approached via the classical empirical risk minimization. Some efforts are then made to develop a framework for analyzing and implementing modal regression. For instance, the modal regression function is described, the modal regression risk is defined explicitly and its Bayes rule is characterized; for the sake of computational tractability, the surrogate modal regression risk, which is termed as the generalization risk in our study, is introduced. On the theoretical side, the excess modal regression risk, the excess generalization risk, the function estimation error, and the relations among the above three quantities are studied rigorously. It turns out that under mild conditions, function estimation consistency and convergence may be pursued in modal regression as in vanilla regression protocols such as mean regression, median regression, and quantile regression. On the practical side, the implementation issues of modal regression including the computational algorithm and the selection of the tuning parameters are discussed. Numerical validations on modal regression are also conducted to verify our findings.", "pdf_url": "http://jmlr.org/papers/volume21/17-068/17-068.pdf", "reference": "Martin Anthony and Peter L.

With more sources, including reviews, news, and pictures, can now be used for data analysis, the authenticity of data sources is in doubt. While previous literature attempted to detect fake data piece by piece, in the current work, we try to capture the fake data sender's strategic behavior to detect the fake data source. Specifically, we model the tension between a data receiver who makes data-driven decisions and a fake data sender who benefits from misleading the receiver. We propose a potentially infinite horizon continuous time game-theoretic model with asymmetric information to capture the fact that the receiver does not initially know the existence of fake data and learns about it during the course of the game. We use point processes to model the data traffic, where each piece of data can occur at any discrete moment in a continuous time flow. We fully solve the model and employ numerical examples to illustrate the players' strategies and payoffs for insights. Specifically, our results show that maintaining some suspicion about the data sources and understanding that the sender can be strategic are very helpful to the data receiver. In addition, based on our model, we propose a methodology of detecting fake data that is complementary to the previous studies on this topic, which suggested various approaches on analyzing the data piece by piece. We show that after analyzing each piece of data, understanding a source by looking at the its whole history of pushing data can be helpful.", "pdf_url": "http://jmlr.org/papers/volume21/17-360/17-360.pdf", "reference": "Hunt Allcott and Matthew Gentzkow.

Due to their close connection to generalized linear models, it is also natural to incorporate covariate information in them. The current paper presents two universal fitting algorithms for networks with edge covariates: one based on nuclear norm penalization and the other based on projected gradient descent. Both algorithms are motivated by maximizing the likelihood function for an existing class of inner-product models, and we establish their statistical rates of convergence for these models. In addition, the theory informs us that both methods work simultaneously for a wide range of different latent space models that allow latent positions to affect edge formation in flexible ways, such as distance models. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the methods is demonstrated on a number of real world network data sets for different statistical tasks, including community detection with and without edge covariates, and network assisted learning.", "pdf_url": "http://jmlr.org/papers/volume21/17-470/17-470.pdf", "reference": "Emmanuel Abbe.

The lawyer data example  We now revisit the lawyer data example in Section 6.2. We label attributes practice, gender, o\ufb03ce, and school as node covariate 1 to 4. Then we set edge covariate X p(cid:96)q ji \u201c 1 if i \u2030 j and the ith and the jth lawyers shared the same (cid:96)th node covariate, and X p(cid:96)q ji \u201c 0 otherwise. Applying Algorithm 4 with the aforementioned turning parameter selection scheme suggests that the \ufb01rst three covariates, i.e., indicators for attributes practice, gender, and o\ufb03ce, should be included in the model. The resulting number of misclustered nodes is 9, a 25% improvement compared to the previously reported 12 misclustered nodes when not using any covariate. This error rate is slightly worse than including a single handpicked covariate, indicator for practice, but it enjoys the merit of not having to manually choose the covariates or tune the parameters. Finally, we also note that the error rate does not change if one use latent vectors derived from all non-zero eigenvalues of the \ufb01tted pG.  ij \u201c X p(cid:96)q  ij \u201c X p(cid:96)q  References  Emmanuel Abbe.

We show that the answer is negative for both deterministic and randomized algorithms applied to essentially any of the interesting geometries and nonsmooth, weakly-smooth, or smooth objective functions. In particular, we show that it is not possible to obtain a polylogarithmic (in the sequential complexity of the problem) number of parallel rounds  with a polynomial (in the dimension) number of queries per round. In the majority of these settings and when the dimension of the space is polynomial in the inverse target accuracy, our lower bounds match the oracle complexity of sequential convex optimization, up to at most a logarithmic factor in the dimension, which makes them (nearly) tight. Another conceptual contribution of our work is in providing a general and streamlined framework for proving lower bounds in the setting of parallel convex optimization. Prior to our work, lower bounds for parallel convex optimization algorithms were only known in a small fraction of the settings considered in this paper, mainly applying to Euclidean ($\\ell_2$) and $\\ell_\\infty$ spaces.", "pdf_url": "http://jmlr.org/papers/volume21/19-771/19-771.pdf", "reference": "E.

In the last expression, the left term in the minimum is lower whenever:  T ln2 T \u2265 (29 ln(dK/\u03b3))  2\u03ba 3+2\u03ba  (cid:16) 1 2  (cid:17) 8(2+3\u03ba)  3+2\u03ba (cid:16) 1 \u03b5  (cid:17) 6  3+2\u03ba ,  and it su\ufb03ces to choose:  Under this choice, as long as d \u2265 T /\u03bd, the oracle complexity is lower bounded by:  (cid:24)  T =  2(ln(\u03bddK/\u03b3))  2\u03ba 3+2\u03ba  (cid:16) 1 \u03b5  (cid:17) 6  3+2\u03ba  (cid:25)  .

We prove finite-sample guarantees on the performance of clustering with respect to this metric when random samples are drawn from multiple intrinsically low-dimensional clusters in high-dimensional space, in the presence of a large number of high-dimensional outliers.  By combining these results with spectral clustering with respect to LLPD, we provide conditions under which the Laplacian eigengap statistic correctly determines the number of clusters for a large class of data sets,  and prove guarantees on the labeling accuracy of the proposed algorithm.  Our methods are quite general and provide performance guarantees for spectral clustering with any ultrametric.  We also introduce an efficient, easy to implement approximation algorithm for the LLPD based on a multiscale analysis of adjacency graphs, which allows for the runtime of LLPD spectral clustering to be quasilinear in the number of data points.

This paper presents a novel algorithm for training recurrent networks, target propagation through time (TPTT), that outperforms standard backpropagation through time (BPTT) on four out of the five problems used for testing. The proposed algorithm is initially tested and compared to BPTT on four synthetic time lag tasks, and its performance is also measured using the sequential MNIST data set. In addition, as TPTT uses target propagation, it allows for discrete nonlinearities and could potentially mitigate the credit assignment problem in more complex recurrent architectures.

The TPTThx was also tested on the MNIST sequence of pixels problem (see Section 3.2). The grid search performed over the same parameter space selected a combination of learning rates identical to the TPTT network used on the same problem. In addition, the accuracy results shown in Table A4 appear too close to call, therefore the performance of the two schemes on this speci\ufb01c problem can be considered nearly identical.  In conclusion, the empirical results suggest that in terms of sequence length the alter- native update rule (i.e. a network that is fully optimised using local targets) outperforms both BPTT and a TPTT network that updates Wxh using the global error directly. Simi- larly to the original TPTT network, the TPTThx converges quicker than BPTT, discovers a common model for the synthetic classi\ufb01cation problems, and has comparable accuracy on the MNIST sequence of pixels problem.

Usage  Each implemented method receives as an input a list of classi\ufb01ers. This list can be either homoge- neous (i.e., all base classi\ufb01ers are of the same type) or heterogeneous (base classi\ufb01ers of different types). The library supports any type of base classi\ufb01ers from scikit-learn.  After instantiation, the method \ufb01t(X, y) is used to \ufb01t the Dynamic Selection method. Predictions for new examples can then be obtained with predict(X) and predict_proba(X). In the example below, we show how to use the library, with a given Training (X_train, y_train), and Testing (X_test, y_test) datasets. The META-DES (Cruz et al., 2015a) technique is used in this example:  from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier from deslib.des.meta_des import METADES  # Train a pool of 10 classifiers pool_classifiers = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=10) pool_classifiers.fit(X_train, y_train) # Initialize the DS model metades = METADES(pool_classifiers)  # Fit the dynamic selection model metades.fit(X_dsel, y_dsel)  # Predict new examples: metades.predict(X_test)  As of version 0.3, each implemented method comes with a list of default values, not requiring a trained list of classi\ufb01ers as input. In such case, the pool of classi\ufb01ers is trained together with the DS algorithm inside the \ufb01t method. More examples of using different aspects of the library can be found on https://deslib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_examples/ index.html.  5. Conclusion and future plans  In this paper, we introduced the DESlib, a Python library with the implementation of the state-of- the-art dynamic classi\ufb01er and ensemble selection techniques. The project is fully compatible with the scikit-learn API and is part of the scikit-learn-contrib supported projects. Future work on this library includes the implementation of dynamic selection methods in different contexts, such as One-Class-Classi\ufb01cation (OCC) and regression.  References  B. Antosik and M.

We suggest here an extension of this concept to the case of functional data. More precisely, the proposed definition concerns those statistical problems where the sample data are real functions defined on a compact interval of the real line. The obvious difficulty for such a functional extension is the non-invertibility of the covariance operator in infinite-dimensional cases. Unlike other recent proposals, our definition is suggested and motivated in terms of the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) associated with the stochastic process that generates the data. The proposed distance is a true metric; it depends on a unique real smoothing parameter which is fully motivated in RKHS terms. Moreover, it shares some properties of its finite dimensional counterpart: it is invariant under isometries, it can be consistently estimated from the data and its sampling distribution is known under Gaussian models. An empirical study for two statistical applications, outliers detection and binary classification, is included. The results are quite competitive when compared to other recent proposals in the literature.", "pdf_url": "http://jmlr.org/papers/volume21/18-156/18-156.pdf", "reference": "1975.

For instance, the cut-o\ufb00 operator is given by  R\u03b1x =  (cid:104)x, ej(cid:105)ej,  (cid:88)  \u03bbj \u2265\u03b1  1 (cid:112)\u03bbj  which corresponds to q(\u03b1, \u03bbj) = 1, when \u03bbj \u2265 \u03b1, and q(\u03b1, \u03bbj) = 0, when \u03bbj < \u03b1. For this choice, the regularization parameter determines the terms of the series that are retained. Other possibility is the so-called Landweber regularization operator, given by q(m, a, \u03bbj) = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 a\u03bbj)m+1, for 0 < a < min{\u03bb\u22121 : \u03bbj > 0}. In this case regularization depends on two parameters, a and m.  j  We believe Tikhonov scheme provides a natural choice with good properties since it depends on just one regularization parameter (unlike Landweber method) and de\ufb01nes a metric in L2[0, 1] (unlike the cut-o\ufb00 approach).

It does not impose  parametric assumptions on the dependence structure. More importantly, such a reduction of dimension  is sufficient in that it  does  not cause  loss of  information. In this paper, we adapt the stationary sliced inverse regression to cope with the rapidly  changing environments. We propose to implement sliced inverse regression in an online fashion. This online  learner consists of two steps. In the first step we construct an online estimate for the  kernel matrix; in the second step we propose two online algorithms, one is motivated by the perturbation method and the other is originated from the gradient descent optimization, to perform   online singular value decomposition. The  theoretical properties of this   online learner are established. We demonstrate the numerical performance of  this  online learner  through simulations and  real world applications.

We establish a connection between the misclassification rate and the notion of minimum energy on the local neighborhood of the SBM. We develop an optimally weighted message passing algorithm to reconstruct labels for SBM based on the minimum energy flow and the eigenvectors of a certain Markov transition matrix. The general SBM considered in this paper allows for unequal-size communities, degree heterogeneity, and different connection probabilities among blocks.

Remaining Proofs  Proof [Proof of Lemma 15] The proof logic here is similar to the k = 2 case. Again, we analyze the message M (u, t) for a particular node u. Use induction on t for the claim  (cid:104)  E  e\u03bbM (u,t)|(cid:96)(u) = l  \u2264 e\u03bb\u00b5t(u,l)e  (cid:105)  \u03bb2\u03c32 t (u) 2  .  The case for t = 0 follows from the assumption about \u00b50(u), \u03c32 Assume that the induction is true for t \u2212 1, and prove the case for t. Note that  0(u) and Cherno\ufb00 bound.  (cid:104)  E  (cid:105)  e\u03bbM (u,t)|(cid:96)(u) = l (cid:104)  (cid:89)  E  e\u03bb\u03b8M (v,t\u22121)|(cid:96)(u) = l  (cid:105)  (cid:104)  (cid:105) e\u03bb\u03b8M (v,t\u22121)|(cid:96)(v) = i  E  Kli  (cid:41)  (cid:41)  (cid:89)  e(\u03bb\u03b8)2  \u03c32  t\u22121(v) 2  e\u03bb\u03b8\u00b5t\u22121(v,i)Kli  (cid:40) k  (cid:88)  i=1  =  =  \u2264  \u2264  v\u2208C(u)  (cid:40) k  (cid:88)  (cid:89)  v\u2208C(u)  i=1  v\u2208C(u)  v\u2208C(u)  (cid:89)  e(\u03bb\u00af\u03b8)2  \u03c32  t\u22121(v) 2  e\u03bb\u03b8[(cid:80)k  i=1 \u00b5t\u22121(v,i)Kli]e(\u03bb\u03b8)2  maxi,j\u2208[k] |\u00b5t\u22121(v,i)\u2212\u00b5t\u22121(v,j)|2 8  ,  where the last step uses the Hoe\ufb00ding\u2019s Lemma. Rearrange the terms, one can see that the above equation implies  (cid:104) e\u03bbM (u,t)|(cid:96)(u) = l  (cid:105)  E  \u2264 e\u03bb (cid:80)  v\u2208C(u) \u03b8(cid:104)Kl\u00b7,\u00b5t\u22121(u)(cid:105)e  \u03bb2\u03b82 (cid:80)  v\u2208C(u)  t\u22121(v)+maxi,j\u2208[k]  (cid:40)  \u03c32  (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12)  \u00b5t\u22121(v,+)\u2212\u00b5t\u22121(v,\u2212) 2  2(cid:41)  (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12)= e\u03bb\u00b5t(u,l)e  \u03bb2\u03c32 t (u) 2  ,  where Kl\u00b7 denotes the l\u2212row of transition matrix K. Apply the Cherno\ufb00 bound to optimize over \u03bb, one can arrive the exponential concentration bound. Induction completes.  To upper bound the misclassi\ufb01cation error, simply plug in  |x| =  mini,j\u2208[k] |\u00b5\u00aft(o, i) \u2212 \u00b5\u00aft(o, j)| 2\u03c3\u00aft(o)  .  Proof [Proof of Proposition 19] Recall that \u03c0((cid:96)\u2202Tt(o)|(cid:96)(o) = i) denotes the probability measure on the leaf labels on depth t, given (cid:96)(o) = i. For the root o, we abbreviate the o . Denote \u00af\u03c0o = 1/k \u00b7 (cid:80)k measure \u03c0((cid:96)\u2202Tt(o)|(cid:96)(o) = i) as \u03c0(i)  Consider (cid:15)\u2217 to be the same as in Theorem 1.2.

Under the condition that  j=1 \u03c0(j) o .  br[T (o)]\u03b82 < 1, Weighted Message Passing for General SBM  we know by the result of Lemma 2.6 in Janson and Mossel (2004), for any i, j \u2208 [k]  lim t\u2192\u221e  d\u03c72  (cid:16)  o , \u03c0(j) \u03c0(i) o  (cid:17)  = lim t\u2192\u221e  (cid:90) (cid:32)  (cid:33)2  d\u03c0(i) o d\u03c0(j) o  d\u03c0(j)  o \u2212 1 \u2264 lim t\u2192\u221e  sup i,j,l  (cid:12) (cid:90) d\u03c0(i) (cid:12) o (cid:12) (cid:12) d\u03c0(j) (cid:12) o  d\u03c0(l) o d\u03c0(j) o  d\u03c0(j)  o \u2212 1  = 0  (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12)  for 1 \u2212 \u03b4 > (cid:15)\u2217.

Putting things together, under the condition that br[T (o)]\u03b82 < 1, we have  Finally, we invoke the multiple testing argument Theorem 2.6 in Tsybakov (2009)).  Lemma 24 (Tsybakov (2009), Proposition 2.4, Theorem 2.6) Let P0, P1, . . . , Pk be probability measures on (X , A) satisfying  then we have for any selector \u03c8 : X \u2192 [k]  1 k  k (cid:88)  i=1  d\u03c72(Pj, P0) \u2264 k\u03b1\u2217  max i\u2208[k]  Pi(\u03c8 (cid:54)= i) \u2265  (1 \u2212 \u03b1\u2217 \u2212  ).  1 k  1 2  Plugging in the result with P0 = \u00af\u03c0o and Pi = \u03c0(i) choose \u03b1(cid:63)(t) \u2192 0 such that  o , we conclude that as t \u2192 \u221e, we can  lim inf t\u2192\u221e  inf \u03c3  max l\u2208[k]  P(\u03c3(o) (cid:54)= (cid:96)(o)|(cid:96)(o) = l) \u2265  (1 \u2212  ).  1 2  1 k Cai, Liang and Rakhlin  Proof [Proof of Proposition 20] The proof is a standard exercise following the idea from Proposition 4.2 in Mossel et al. (2012). First, let\u2019s recall Bernstein inequality. Consider X \u223c Binom(n, p0), then the following concentration inequality holds  P(X \u2265 np0 + t) \u2264 exp(\u2212  t2 2(np0 + t/3)  ).  Hence if we plug in t = 2  3 log n +  2np0 log n, we know  |\u2202G1|  sto. \u2264 X \u2264 np0 +  log n + (cid:112)2np0 log n \u2264 2np0 + 2 log n  \u221a  2 3  with probability at least 1 \u2212 n\u22121.  Now, through union bound, we can prove that  P (\u2200r \u2264 R, |\u2202Gr| \u2264 (2np0 + 2 log n)r) \u2265 1 \u2212 C \u00b7 (2np0 + 2 log n)Rn\u22121 \u2265 1 \u2212 O(n\u22123/4).  And we know that on the same event,  |\u2202Gr| \u2264 n1/4, \u2200r \u2264 R.  It is clear that bad events that GR is not a tree (with cycles) for each layer is bounded 0|\u2202Gr| + p0|\u2202Gr|2. Take a further union bound over all layers, we know this  above by p2 probability is bounded by O(n\u22121/8) provided p0 = o(n\u22125/8).  Now we need to recursively use the Poisson-Binomial coupling (to achieve Poisson- Multinomial coupling). The following Lemma is taken from Mossel et al. (2012) (Lemma 4.6).  Lemma 25 If m, n are positive integers then  (cid:107)Binom(m,  ) \u2212 Poisson(c)(cid:107)T V \u2264 O(  c n  c2m n2 + c|  m n  \u2212 1|)  Now we condition on all the good events up to layer Gr\u22121, which happens with proba- bility at least 1 \u2212 n\u22121/8 \u2212 n\u22123/4. We can couple the next layer for nodes in \u2202Gr. Take a node v \u2208 \u2202Gr as an example. Assume it is of color i, then the number of color j nodes in his children follows Binom(|V i >r|, pij). Comparing to the Poisson version Poisson(nipij), we know with probability at least  1 \u2212 O(nip2  ij + pij|V i  >r \u2212 ni|),  one can couple the Poisson and Binomial in the same probability space. Note that |V i >r \u2212 ni| \u2264 |\u2202Gr|.

This paradigm serves naturally in applications such as severe disease diagnosis and spam detection, where people have clear priorities among the two error types. Recently, Tong, Feng, and Li (2018) proposed a nonparametric umbrella algorithm that adapts all scoring-type classification methods (e.g., logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest) to respect the given type I error (i.e., conditional probability of classifying a class $0$ observation as class $1$ under the 0-1 coding) upper bound $\\alpha$ with high probability, without specific  distributional assumptions on the features and the responses. Universal the umbrella algorithm is, it demands an explicit minimum sample size requirement on class $0$, which is often the more scarce class, such as in rare disease diagnosis applications. In this work, we employ the parametric linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model and propose a new parametric thresholding algorithm, which does not need the minimum sample size requirements on class $0$ observations and thus is suitable for small sample applications such as rare disease diagnosis. Leveraging both the existing nonparametric and the newly proposed parametric thresholding rules, we propose four LDA-based NP classifiers, for both low- and high-dimensional settings. On the theoretical front, we prove NP oracle inequalities for one proposed classifier, where the rate for excess type II error benefits from the explicit parametric model assumption. Furthermore, as NP classifiers involve a sample splitting step of class $0$ observations,  we construct a new adaptive sample splitting scheme that can be applied universally to NP classifiers, and this adaptive strategy reduces the type II error of these classifiers. The proposed NP classifiers are implemented in the R package nproc.  [ ][ ]", "pdf_url": "http://jmlr.org/papers/volume21/18-577/18-577.pdf", "reference": "A. Bloemendal, L. Erdos, A. Knowles, H.-T.

The principal axes in PCA were shown to be equivalent to the maximum marginal likelihood estimator of the factor loading matrix in a latent factor model for the observed data, assuming that the latent factors are independently distributed as standard normal distributions. However, the independence assumption may be unrealistic for many scenarios such as modeling multiple time series, spatial processes, and functional data, where the outcomes are correlated.  In this paper, we introduce the generalized probabilistic principal component analysis (GPPCA) to study the latent factor model for multiple correlated outcomes, where each factor is modeled by a Gaussian process. Our method generalizes the previous probabilistic formulation of PCA (PPCA)  by providing the closed-form maximum marginal likelihood estimator of the factor loadings and other parameters.  Based on the explicit expression of the precision matrix in the marginal likelihood that we derived, the number of the computational operations is linear to the number of output variables. Furthermore, we also provide the closed-form expression of the marginal likelihood when   other covariates are included in the mean structure. We highlight the advantage of GPPCA in terms of the practical relevance, estimation accuracy and computational convenience.  Numerical studies of simulated and real data confirm the excellent finite-sample performance of the proposed approach.

The predictive distribution of the test output by the PPCA was obtained in a similar fashion as the Equation (24) in the GPPCA and the empirical mean for the test output was added back for comparison. The PPCA does not incorporate the temporal correlation and linear trend in the model.  The temporal model is constructed by a GaSP separately for each test location. The Mat\u00b4ern kernel in (10) and the linear trend h(x) = (1, x) are assumed for the temporal model. The spatial model uses a GaSP with a constant mean separately for each test month. The product kernel in (8) is assumed for the two-dimensional input (latitude and longitude) and the Mat\u00b4ern kernel in (10) is used for each subkernel. The range and the nugget parameters in the temporal model and spatial model are estimated using the RobustGaSP R package (Gu et al. (2019)), and the predictions are also obtained by this package.  The temporal regression by the random forest are trained separately for each location. For each test month, the 439 observations of that month are used as the responses and the 439 \u00d7 220 output on the other months for the same locations are used as the covariates. The regression parameters of this temporal regression capture the temporal dependence of the output between the test month and the training months. The 1200 \u00d7 200 matrix of the temperature anomalies at the test locations and observed time points are used as the test input. The spatial regression by the random forest uses 220 observations of a test location as responses and the 220 \u00d7 439 matrix of the temperature anomalies of the observed locations are used as the input. The 20 \u00d7 439 matrix of the temperature anomalies at the observed locations and test time points are used as the test input. The randomForest R package (Liaw and Wiener, 2002) is used for training models and compute predictions.  The spatio-temporal model assumes a 3 dimensional product kernel in (8) for both time points and locations, and the Mat\u00b4ern kernel in (10) is used as the subkernel for each input variables. Note that if we use the whole training output, the computational order of inverting the covariance matrix is O(N 3), where N = 369360 is the total number of inputs, which is computationally challenging. When the output can be written as an n1 \u00d7 n2 matrix, the likelihood corresponds to a matrix normal distribution, where two kernel functions model the correlation between rows and between columns of the output. The computational order of the matrix normal distribution is the maximum of O(n3 2). We choose the 439\u00d7240 temperature anomalies at the locations with the whole observations to estimate the parameters. The constant mean is assumed for each location. The MLE is used for estimating the range parameters in kernel, nugget, mean and variance parameters. After plugging in the parameters, the predictive distribution of the test data is used for predictions. Though only 439\u00d7240 observations are used for estimating the parameters due to the computational convenience, all 369360 training observations are used for computing the predictive distribution of the test output.  1) and O(n3  References  P.-A.

We derive second order cone formulations for the resulting dual and primal problems.  The concept of kernel function, widely applied in $\\ell_2$-SVM,  is extended to the more general case of $\\ell_p$-norms with $p>1$ by defining a new operator called multidimensional kernel. This object gives rise to reformulations of dual problems, in a transformed space of the original data, where the dependence on the original data always appear as homogeneous polynomials. We adapt known solution algorithms to efficiently solve the primal and dual resulting problems and some computational experiments on real-world datasets are presented showing rather good behavior in terms of the accuracy of $\\ell_p$-SVM with $p>1$.", "pdf_url": "http://jmlr.org/papers/volume21/18-601/18-601.pdf", "reference": "J.

Sometimes referred to as manifold learning, this problem is closely related to the problem of localization, which aims at embedding a weighted graph into a low-dimensional Euclidean space.  Several methods have been proposed for localization, and also manifold learning. Nonetheless, the robustness property of most of them is little understood. In this paper, we obtain perturbation bounds for classical scaling and trilateration, which are then applied to derive performance bounds for Isomap, Landmark Isomap, and Maximum Variance Unfolding.

For every (r, t) \u2208 [R]\u00d7[T ], for every (cid:96) \u2208 [log d(cid:48)], query Hashtogram(Sr,(cid:96)) to get  (cid:8)ar,(cid:96)(t, b) : b{0, 1}(cid:9).  Now, every one of the steps 1b,2,3,4 of the algorithm Bitstogram contains a loop over every choice of (r, t) \u2208 [R]\u00d7[T ], and we can group all of this steps together into one loop over (r, t) \u2208 [R]\u00d7[T ]. If an iteration of this loop results in a value a(\u02c6vr,t) \u2264 n, we can simply ignore it (recall that the frequencies of domain elements that are not in the list L n is less than the guaranteed bound on the error of the are estimated as zero, and that protocol, so this step does not e\ufb00ect our error bounds).

Proof of Theorem 5.1  It is easy to see that each invocation of LocalRnd is (cid:15)/2-locally di\ufb00erentially private since conditioned on any realization of (cid:96)i, ji, ri, for any pair of possible input items vi, v(cid:48) i \u2208 V to LocalRnd and any output bit b generated in step 7 of Algorithm 1, we have  P [yi = b | vi] \u2264 e(cid:15)/2 P (cid:2)yi = b | v(cid:48)  (cid:3)  i  Note that LocalRnd is invoked only twice for each user: once when Final = 0 (the scanning/pruning phase of TreeHist) and another time when Final = 1 (the \ufb01nal phase of TreeHist). Thus, it follows that protocol TreeHist is (cid:15)-di\ufb00erentially private.  A.2. Proof of Theorem 5.2  Let \u03b2 \u2208 (0, 1) and \u03b7 as de\ufb01ned in the theorem statement. Consider the pruning phase of TreeHist, that is, Steps 1 to 11 in Algorithm 3. Let \u03b3 be as set in Step 2. In this phase, TreeHist invokes FreqOracle once in every iteration of the outer for loop (over the levels of the tree) with the \ufb02ag Final = 0. Consider any such iteration (cid:96). Suppose, for now, that the size of ChildSet(Pre\ufb01xes) passed to FreqOracle in that iteration is at most 2n/\u03b7. (We will show that with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b2 this condition is satis\ufb01ed at all levels (cid:96) of the tree, i.e., it\u2019s a loop invariant). By invoking Lemma 5.3 with (cid:98)V = ChildSet(Pre\ufb01xes), (cid:8)\u02dcIj : j \u2208 [t](cid:9) = (cid:8)I(cid:96),j : j \u2208 [t](cid:9), and \u03b3 = t log d = 110 log(n/\u03b2) log d, we have that with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b2/ log(d), for every \u02c6v \u2208 ChildSet(Pre\ufb01xes) : f (\u02c6v) > 3\u03b7, FreqOracle gives an estimate \u02c6f (\u02c6v) \u2265 2\u03b7, and for every \u02c6v \u2208 ChildSet(Pre\ufb01xes) : f (\u02c6v) \u2264 \u03b7, FreqOracle gives an estimate \u02c6f (\u02c6v) < 2\u03b7. Hence, Step 9 implies, that with probability at least 1\u2212\u03b2/ log d, all \u02c6v \u2208 ChildSet(Pre\ufb01xes) with true frequencies f (\u02c6v) \u2265 3\u03b7 will proceed to the next iteration (cid:96) + 1 and all those \u02c6v \u2208 ChildSet(Pre\ufb01xes) with true frequencies f (\u02c6v) < \u03b7 will be pruned out. Since the number of nodes \u02c6v with true frequency f (\u02c6v) \u2265 \u03b7 cannot be more than n/\u03b7, then the number of surviving nodes in the next iteration (cid:96) + 1 cannot be more than 2n/\u03b7. Hence, this condition will be satis\ufb01ed in the next iteration, and we can proceed in the same fashion. Note that when (cid:96) = 1, the condition is trivially satis\ufb01ed since there are only 2 < 2n/\u03b7 nodes at that level. This induction argument shows that with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b2, for every level (cid:96) \u2208 [log d], the surviving nodes at level (cid:96) correspond to pre\ufb01xes whose true frequencies are not below \u03b7 and include all pre\ufb01xes whose true frequencies are above 3\u03b7. In particular, Bassily, Nissim, Stemmer, Thakurta  with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b2, all items in SuccHist satisfy these properties. This covers the proof of items 1 and 2 of Theorem 5.2.  Now, consider the \ufb01nal phase of TreeHist, that is, Steps 12 to 14 Algorithm 3. Let \u03b3 be as set in Step 12. In this phase, TreeHist invokes FreqOracle on the surviving nodes at the \ufb01nal level of the tree (the last update of Pre\ufb01xes) and with input \ufb02ag Final = 1. Now, by invoking Lemma 5.3 with (cid:98)V = Pre\ufb01xes, (cid:8)\u02dcIj : j \u2208 [t](cid:9) = (cid:8)Ij : j \u2208 [t](cid:9), and \u03b3 = t = 110 log(n/\u03b2), we have that with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b2/ log(d), for every \u02c6v \u2208 Pre\ufb01xes, | \u02c6f (\u02c6v) \u2212 f (\u02c6v)| \u2264 14  . This proves item 3 of the  nt/(cid:15) = O  n log(n/\u03b2)  (cid:18) \u221a  \u221a  (cid:19)  (cid:15)  theorem.  B. Missing Proofs from Section 6  B.1. Proof of Lemma 6.5  Consider the following good event:  Event E1 (over sampling h1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, hR): For every query v\u2217 \u2208 V there exists a subset Rv\u2217 r\u2217 \u2208 Rv\u2217 1  1 \u2286 [R] of size |Rv\u2217 it holds that |{v \u2208 S : v (cid:54)= v\u2217 and hr\u2217(v) = hr\u2217(v\u2217)}| \u2264 16n T .  1 | \u2265 7  8 R s.t. for every  Event E1 states that for at least 7R/8 of the hash functions, we have that v\u2217 is mapped into a cell without too many collisions with di\ufb00erent input elements. Informally, for every single hash function hr, algorithm HashHist estimates the number of occurrences of hr(v\u2217) in S. Hence, if event E1 occurs, then most of the estimations result in accurate answers. We start by showing that event E1 happens with high probability. To that end, \ufb01x v\u2217 \u2208 V and \ufb01x r\u2217 \u2208 [R]. We have that  Ehr\u2217 [| {x \u2208 S : v (cid:54)= v\u2217 and hr\u2217(v) = hr\u2217(v\u2217)} |] =  (cid:88)  Ehr\u2217  (cid:2)1hr\u2217 (v)=hr\u2217 (v\u2217)  (cid:3) \u2264  n T  .  v\u2208S:v(cid:54)=v\u2217  Thus, by Markov\u2019s inequality, we have that  (cid:20)  Pr hr\u2217  | {v \u2208 S : v (cid:54)= v\u2217 and hr\u2217(v) = hr\u2217(v\u2217)} | \u2265  (cid:21)  16n T  \u2264  1 16  .  As the hash functions are independent from each other, for R \u2265 48 ln( d(cid:48) \u03b2 ), by the Cherno\ufb00 bound we get that with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b2/d(cid:48) (over sampling h1, . . . , hR) there exists a subset Rv\u2217  8 R s.t. for every r\u2217 \u2208 Rv\u2217  1 \u2286 [R] of size |Rv\u2217  it holds that  1 | \u2265 7|{v \u2208 S : v (cid:54)= v\u2217 and hr\u2217(v) = hr\u2217(v\u2217)}| \u2264  16n T  .  Using the union bound, we have that event E1 happens with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b2. We continue the analysis assuming that event E1 occurs. Practical Locally Private Heavy Hitters  For every r \u2208 [R], let Sr = (vj)j\u2208Ir denote a database containing the data of all users j s.t. j \u2208 Ir. Also for v\u2217 \u2208 V and r \u2208 [R] denote |Sr,v\u2217| (cid:44) |{v \u2208 S : hr(v) = hr(v\u2217)}|. That is, |Sr,v\u2217| is the number of users j s.t. hr(vj) = hr(v\u2217). Furthermore, for v\u2217 \u2208 V and r \u2208 [R] denote |I v\u2217 r | (cid:44) |{v \u2208 Sr : hr(v) = hr(v\u2217)}|. That is, |I v\u2217 r | is the number of users j s.t. j \u2208 Ir and hr(vj) = hr(v\u2217). Observe that |Sr,v\u2217| \u2265 fS(v\u2217) and that |I v\u2217  r | \u2265 fSr (v\u2217).  Fix v\u2217 \u2208 V . By the Cherno\ufb00 bound, with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b2/d(cid:48) (over partitioning  [n] into subsets I1, . . . , IR), for every r \u2208 [R] we have that  (cid:12) (cid:12) R \u00b7 |I v\u2217 (cid:12)  r | \u2212 |Sr,v\u2217  |  (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) \u2264  (cid:115)  3R \u00b7 |Sr,v\u2217| \u00b7 log(  2Rd(cid:48) \u03b2  ).  (4)  Using the union bound this holds simultaneously for every v\u2217 \u2208 V and r \u2208 [R] with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b2. Also, assuming that n \u2265 8R log(2R/\u03b2), by the Cherno\ufb00 bound, with probability at least 1\u2212\u03b2 (over partitioning [n] into subsets I1, . . . , IR), for every r \u2208 [R] we have that n R . We continue the analysis assuming that this is the case, and that Inequality (4) holds.  2R \u2264 |Ir| \u2264 2n  Event E2 (over sampling Z and the coins of the local randomizers): 2 \u2286 [R] of size |Rv\u2217 For every query v\u2217 \u2208 V there exists a subset Rv\u2217 r\u2217 | (cid:12) (cid:12) \u2264 e(cid:15)+1 (cid:12) R \u00b7 ar\u2217(hr\u2217(v\u2217)) \u2212 R \u00b7 |I v\u2217 r\u2217 \u2208 Rv\u2217 11nR. e(cid:15)\u22121 \u00b7 2  it holds that (cid:12)  2 | \u2265 7  \u221a  8 R s.t. for every  For v\u2217 \u2208 V and r \u2208 [R] denote cr(v\u2217) = (cid:80)  Hashtogram answers the query v\u2217 with a(v\u2217) = R \u00b7 e(cid:15)+1 and r \u2208 [R].

While being conceptually and computationally appealing, this method involves the problematic need to also split the prior for the local inferences; these weakened priors may not provide enough regularization for each separate computation, thus eliminating one of the key advantages of Bayesian methods. To resolve this dilemma while still retaining the generalizability of the underlying local inference method, we apply the idea of expectation propagation (EP) as a framework for distributed Bayesian inference. The central idea is to iteratively update approximations to the local likelihoods given the state of the other approximations and the prior. The present paper has two roles: we review the steps that are needed to keep EP algorithms numerically stable, and we suggest a general approach, inspired by EP, for approaching data partitioning problems in a way that achieves the computational benefits of parallelism while allowing each local update to make use of relevant information from the other sites. In addition, we demonstrate how the method can be applied in a hierarchical context to make use of partitioning of both data and parameters. The paper describes a general algorithmic framework, rather than a specific algorithm, and presents an example implementation for it.", "pdf_url": "http://jmlr.org/papers/volume21/18-817/18-817.pdf", "reference": "Sungjin Ahn, Anoop Korattikara, and Max Welling.

Hofmeyr", "time": "21(18):1\u221235, 2020.", "abstract": "We study the connections between spectral clustering and the problems of maximum margin clustering, and estimation of the components of level sets of a density function. Specifically, we obtain bounds on the eigenvectors of graph Laplacian matrices in terms of the between cluster separation, and within cluster connectivity. These bounds ensure that the spectral clustering solution converges to the maximum margin clustering solution as the scaling parameter is reduced towards zero. The sensitivity of maximum margin clustering solutions to outlying points is well known, but can be mitigated by first removing such outliers, and applying maximum margin clustering to the remaining points. If outliers are identified using an estimate of the underlying probability density, then the remaining points may be seen as an estimate of a level set of this density function. We show that such an approach can be used to consistently estimate the components of the level sets of a density function under very mild assumptions.", "pdf_url": "http://jmlr.org/papers/volume21/18-850/18-850.pdf", "reference": "Daniel Alspach and Harold Sorenson.

In high-dimensional problems, detecting interactions is challenging due to  combinatorial complexity and limited data information. We consider detecting interactions by exploring their connections with the principal Hessian matrix. Specifically, we propose a one-step synthetic approach for estimating the principal Hessian matrix by a penalized M-estimator. An alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is proposed to efficiently solve the encountered regularized optimization problem. Based on the sparse estimator, we  detect the interactions by identifying its nonzero components. Our method directly targets at the interactions, and it requires no structural assumption on the hierarchy of the interactions effects.  We show that our estimator is theoretically valid, computationally efficient, and practically useful for detecting the interactions in a broad spectrum of scenarios.", "pdf_url": "http://jmlr.org/papers/volume21/19-071/19-071.pdf", "reference": "P.

High-Dimensional Interactions Detection  Appendix  Proof of Proposition 3  Since Z = \u03a3\u22121X, we have Var(Z) = \u03a3\u22121, and Cov(Z, X) = I. Under model (2),  Y \u2212 E(Y ) =  \u03b2k(cid:96){XkX(cid:96) \u2212 E(XkX(cid:96))} +  \u03b8kXk + (cid:15).  (10)  p (cid:88)  p (cid:88)  k=1  (cid:96)=k  p (cid:88)  k=1  Then, we have from C1 of Condition 2  \u03a8 = E{Y \u2212 E(Y )ZZ T} = E  \u03b2kl{XkX(cid:96) \u2212 E(XkX(cid:96))}ZZ T  .  (cid:35)  (cid:34) p  (cid:88)  p (cid:88)  k=1  (cid:96)=k  (cid:96)=k \u03b2k(cid:96)Cov(XkX(cid:96), ZiZj). Then Proposition 3 follows from C2  This implies \u03c8ij = (cid:80)p of Condition 2.  k=1  (cid:80)p  Proof of Lemma 4  We prove the main results following the framework of penalized M-estimator as in Negahban et al. (2012) with (cid:96)1 penalty function.  Let L(\u03a8) = tr(\u03a8TS\u03a8S) \u2212 2tr(\u03a8Q), and denote by \u03a8\u2217 the truth of \u03a8. By the de\ufb01nition  L( (cid:98)\u03a8) + \u03bb(cid:107) (cid:98)\u03a8(cid:107)1 \u2264 L(\u03a8\u2217) + \u03bb(cid:107) (cid:98)\u03a8\u2217(cid:107)1.  For ease in presentation, we take (cid:98)\u03a8 to be symmetric. Let (cid:98)\u2206 = (cid:98)\u03a8 \u2212 \u03a8\u2217, then we have  L(\u03a8\u2217 + (cid:98)\u2206) \u2212 L(\u03a8\u2217) + \u03bb(cid:107) (cid:98)\u03a8(cid:107)1 \u2264 \u03bb(cid:107) (cid:98)\u03a8\u2217(cid:107)1.

We observe that with large probability 2(cid:107)S\u03a8\u2217S \u2212 Q(cid:107)\u221e < \u03bb/2.

This completes the proof of Lemma 4. Tang, Fang, and Dong  Proof of Lemma 5  From the proof of Lemma 4, Lemma 5 follows straightforwardly by noting that  2tr( (cid:98)\u2206S (cid:98)\u2206S) + \u03bb(cid:107) (cid:98)\u2206(cid:107)1 = 2tr( (cid:98)\u2206S (cid:98)\u2206S) + \u03bb(cid:107) (cid:98)\u03a8U \u2212 \u03a8\u2217  U (cid:107)1 + \u03bb(cid:107) (cid:98)\u03a8U c(cid:107)1  \u2264 4\u03bb(cid:107) (cid:98)\u03a8U \u2212 \u03a8\u2217  U (cid:107).  (14)  Proof of Theorem 7  We further note that  tr( (cid:98)\u2206S (cid:98)\u2206S) = vecT( (cid:98)\u2206)(S \u2297 S)vec( (cid:98)\u2206).  Then the oracle inequality (14) and the restricted eigenvalue condition (9) imply that  2tr( (cid:98)\u2206S (cid:98)\u2206S) + \u03bb(cid:107) (cid:98)\u03a8U \u2212 \u03a8\u2217  U (cid:107)1 + \u03bb(cid:107) (cid:98)\u03a8U c(cid:107)1 \u2264 4\u03bb(cid:107) (cid:98)\u03a8U \u2212 \u03a8\u2217  U (cid:107)1  \u2264 4\u03bb|U|1/2{vecT(\u2206)(S \u2297 S)vec(\u2206)}1/2/\u03b3 \u2264 vecT(\u2206)(S \u2297 S)vec(\u2206) + 4\u03bb2|U|/\u03b32 = tr( (cid:98)\u2206S (cid:98)\u2206S) + 4\u03bb2|U|/\u03b32.  tr( (cid:98)\u2206S (cid:98)\u2206S) + \u03bb(cid:107) (cid:98)\u03a8 \u2212 \u03a8\u2217(cid:107)1 \u2264 4\u03bb2|U|/\u03b32  (15)  That is  This completes the proof of Theorem 7.  5.3. Proof of Theorem 9  Let \u2206\u03a3 = S \u2212 \u03a3X . By its de\ufb01nition  S\u03a8\u2217S \u2212 Q = (\u03a3X + \u2206\u03a3)\u03a8\u2217(\u03a3X + \u2206\u03a3) \u2212 Q  = \u03a3X \u03a8\u2217\u03a3X \u2212 Q + \u2206\u03a3\u03a8\u2217\u03a3X + \u03a3X \u03a8\u2217\u2206\u03a3 + \u2206\u03a3\u03a8\u2217\u2206\u03a3.  Then by Condition 8 and Lemma A.3 of Bickel and Levina (2008), (cid:107)\u2206\u03a3(cid:107)\u221e = Op((cid:112)log p/n). Additionally, since \u03a3X \u03a8\u2217\u03a3X = \u03a3Y XX , and (cid:107)\u03a3Y XX \u2212 Q(cid:107)\u221e = Op((cid:112)log p/n) follows from Condition 8, similar to that of Lemma A.3 of Bickel and Levina (2008). Then Theorem 9 follows by establishing that (cid:107)S\u03a8\u2217S \u2212 Q(cid:107)\u221e = Op((cid:112)log p/n) and applying the triangular inequality and the condition that (cid:107)\u03a8\u2217(cid:107)\u221e = O  , (cid:107)\u03a8\u2217\u03a3X (cid:107)\u221e = O(1).  (cid:17) (cid:16)(cid:112)n/log p  5.4. Proof of Theorem 11  The \ufb01rst order conditon of (5) implies that  0 = S (cid:98)\u03a8S \u2212 Q + \u03bbZ  where Z = sign( (cid:98)\u03a8). Let \u03b7 = vec( (cid:98)\u03a8), \u03b7\u2217 = vec(\u03a8\u2217), \u03be = vec(Q), and \u03c4 = vec(Z). By writing in vector form, we have  (cid:18)\u039b11 \u039b12 \u039b21 \u039b22  (cid:19) (cid:18)\u03b71 \u2212 \u03b7\u2217(cid:19)  \u03b72  \u2212  (cid:19)  (cid:18)\u03be1 \u2212 \u039b11\u03b7\u2217 1 \u03be2 \u2212 \u039b21\u03b7\u2217 1  + \u03bb  = 0  (cid:19)  (cid:18)\u03c41 \u03c42 High-Dimensional Interactions Detection  where (\u03b7T 1 , \u03b7T \u03b72 = 0, we must have  2 )T is the decomposition of vec( (cid:98)\u03a8) corresponding to the set U. Then to ensure  \u03b71 \u2212 \u03b7\u2217  1 = \u039b\u22121 \u03c42 = \u039b21\u039b\u22121  11 (\u03be1 \u2212 \u039b11\u03b7\u2217  1) \u2212 \u03bb\u039b\u22121  11 \u03c41,  11 Z1 + \u03bb\u22121(\u03be2 \u2212 \u039b21\u039b\u22121  11 \u03be1)  where Z1 is the component of Z corresponding to the blocking. Then the irrepresentable condition (8) implies that \u03b72 = 0 with probability tending to 1, and the minimal signal strength condition | min(\u03a8\u2217 11 (cid:107)\u221e ensures that \u03b72 is bounded around from 0 with probability tending to 1.

With the above lemma, and using a similar argument as that for Lemma 19, we can  prove Lemma 21. We thus skip it.  Appendix B. Learning with Kernel Methods  In this appendix, we review how the regression setting considered in this paper covers non-parametric regression with kernel methods.  Let the input space \u039e be a closed subset of Euclidean space Rd, the output space Y \u2286 R. Let \u00b5 be an unknown but \ufb01xed Borel probability measure on \u039e \u00d7 Y . Assume that {(\u03bei, yi)}m i=1 are i.i.d. from the distribution \u00b5. A reproducing kernel K is a symmetric function K : \u039e \u00d7 \u039e \u2192 R such that (K(ui, uj))(cid:96) i,j=1 is positive semide\ufb01nite for any \ufb01nite set of points {ui}(cid:96) i=1 in \u039e. The kernel K de\ufb01nes a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) (HK, (cid:107) \u00b7 (cid:107)K) as the completion of the linear span of the set {K\u03be(\u00b7) := K(\u03be, \u00b7) : \u03be \u2208 \u039e} with respect to the inner product (cid:104)K\u03be, Ku(cid:105)K := K(\u03be, u). For any f \u2208 HK, the reproducing property holds: f (\u03be) = (cid:104)K\u03be, f (cid:105)K.  Example B.1 (Sobolev Spaces) Let X = [0, 1] and the kernel  K(x, x(cid:48)) =  (cid:40)  (1 \u2212 y)x, x \u2264 y; (1 \u2212 x)y, x \u2265 y.  (cid:90)  inf f \u2208HK  \u039e\u00d7Y  (f (\u03be) \u2212 y)2d\u00b5(\u03be, y).  (cid:90)  inf f \u2208HK  \u039e\u00d7Y  ((cid:104)f, K\u03be(cid:105)K \u2212 y)2d\u00b5(\u03be, y).  Then the kernel induces a Sobolev Space H = {f : X \u2192 R|f is absolutely continuous , f (0) = f (1) = 0, f \u2208 L2(X)}.  In learning with kernel methods, one considers the following minimization problem  Since f (\u03be) = (cid:104)K\u03be, f (cid:105)K by the reproducing property, the above can be rewritten as  Letting X = {K\u03be : \u03be \u2208 \u039e} and de\ufb01ning another probability measure \u03c1(K\u03be, y) = \u00b5(\u03be, y), the above reduces to the learning setting in Section 1.

Learning a structured graph is essential for interpretability and identification of the relationships among data. In general, learning a graph with a specific structure is an NP-hard combinatorial problem and thus designing a general tractable algorithm is challenging. Some useful structured graphs include connected, sparse, multi-component, bipartite, and regular graphs. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework for structured graph learning that combines Gaussian graphical model and spectral graph theory. We propose to convert combinatorial structural constraints into spectral constraints on graph matrices and develop an optimization framework based on block majorization-minimization to solve structured graph learning problem. The proposed algorithms are provably convergent and practically amenable for a number of graph based applications such as data clustering. Extensive numerical experiments with both synthetic and real data sets illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

When the sample size N and the number of features p are both large, the implementation of classic screening methods can be numerically challenging. In this paper, we propose a distributed screening framework for big data setup. In the spirit of 'divide-and-conquer', the proposed framework expresses a correlation measure as a function of several component parameters, each of which can be distributively estimated using a natural U-statistic from data segments. With the component estimates aggregated, we obtain a final correlation estimate that can be readily used for screening features. This framework enables distributed storage and parallel computing and thus is computationally attractive. Due to the unbiased distributive estimation of the component parameters, the final aggregated estimate achieves a high accuracy that  is insensitive to the number of data segments m. Under mild conditions, we show that the aggregated correlation estimator is as efficient as the centralized estimator in terms of the probability convergence bound and the mean squared error rate; the corresponding screening procedure enjoys sure screening property for a wide range of correlation measures. The promising performances of the new method are supported by extensive numerical examples.", "pdf_url": "http://jmlr.org/papers/volume21/19-537/19-537.pdf"}, "Lower Bounds for Testing Graphical Models: Colorings and Antiferromagnetic Ising Models": {"volumn": 21, "url": "http://jmlr.org/papers/v21/19-580.html", "header": "Lower Bounds for Testing Graphical Models: Colorings and Antiferromagnetic Ising Models", "author": "Ivona Bez\u00c3\u00a1kov\u00c3\u00a1, Antonio Blanca, Zongchen Chen, Daniel \u00c5\u00a0tefankovi\u00c4\u008d, Eric Vigoda", "time": "21(25):1\u221262, 2020.", "abstract": "We study the identity testing problem in the context of spin systems or undirected graphical models, where it takes the following form: given the parameter specification of the model $M$ and a sampling oracle for the distribution $\\mu_{M^*}$ of an unknown model $M^*$, can we efficiently determine if the two models $M$ and $M^*$ are the same? We consider identity testing for both soft-constraint and hard-constraint systems. In particular, we prove hardness results in two prototypical cases, the Ising model and proper colorings, and explore whether identity testing is any easier than structure learning. For the ferromagnetic (attractive) Ising model, Daskalakis et al. (2018) presented a polynomial-time algorithm for identity testing. We prove hardness results in the antiferromagnetic (repulsive) setting in the same regime of parameters where structure learning is known to require a super-polynomial number of samples.

In addition, the approach allows specification of target matrices through which prior knowledge may be incorporated and which can stabilize the estimation procedure in high-dimensional settings. The result is a targeted fused ridge estimator that is of use when the precision matrices of the constituent classes are believed to chiefly share the same structure while potentially differing in a number of locations of interest.

Given the samples $(x_i,y_i)_{i=1}^{n}$, our goal is to recover smooth, robust estimates of the clean  samples $f(x_i) \\bmod  1$. We formulate a natural approach for solving this problem, which works with angular embeddings of  the noisy mod 1 samples over the unit circle, inspired by the angular synchronization framework. This amounts to solving a smoothness regularized least-squares problem -- a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) -- where the variables are constrained to lie on the unit circle. Our proposed approach is based on solving its relaxation, which is a trust-region sub-problem and hence solvable efficiently. We provide theoretical guarantees demonstrating its robustness to noise for adversarial, as well as random Gaussian and Bernoulli noise models. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first such theoretical results for this problem. We demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our proposed approach via extensive numerical simulations on synthetic data, along with a simple least-squares based solution for the unwrapping stage, that recovers the original samples of $f$ (up to a global shift). It is shown to perform well at high levels of noise, when taking as input the denoised modulo $1$ samples. Finally, we also consider two other approaches for denoising the modulo 1 samples that leverage tools from Riemannian optimization on manifolds, including a Burer-Monteiro approach for a semidefinite programming relaxation of our formulation.

In this paper, we introduce Fenchel-Young losses, a generic way to construct a convex loss function for a regularized prediction function. We provide an in-depth study of their properties in a very broad setting, covering all the aforementioned supervised learning tasks, and revealing new connections between sparsity, generalized entropies, and separation margins.

Such data hold promise for scientific discoveries but also pose challenges to analyses. One potential challenge is noise accumulation. In this paper, we explore noise accumulation in high dimensional two-group classification. First, we revisit a previous assessment of noise accumulation with principal component analyses, which yields a different threshold for discriminative ability than originally identified. Then we extend our scope to its impact on classifiers developed with three common machine learning approaches---random forest, support vector machine, and boosted classification trees. We simulate four scenarios with differing amounts of signal strength to evaluate each method. After determining noise accumulation may affect the performance of these classifiers, we assess factors that impact it. We conduct simulations by varying sample size, signal strength, signal strength proportional to the number predictors, and signal magnitude with random forest classifiers. These simulations suggest that noise accumulation affects the discriminative ability of high-dimensional classifiers developed using common machine learning methods, which can be modified by sample size, signal strength, and signal magnitude. We developed the measure total signal index (TSI) to track the trends of total signal and noise accumulation.

While multi-view clustering algorithms were proposed, the uncertainty quantification remains difficult --- a particular challenge is in the high complexity of estimating the cluster assignment probability under each view, and sharing information among views. In this article, we propose an approximate Bayes approach --- treating the similarity matrices generated over the views as rough first-stage estimates for the co-assignment probabilities; in its Kullback-Leibler neighborhood, we obtain a refined low-rank matrix, formed by the pairwise product of simplex coordinates. Interestingly, each simplex coordinate directly encodes the cluster assignment uncertainty. For multi-view clustering, we let each view draw a  parameterization from a few candidates, leading to dimension reduction. With high model flexibility, the estimation can be efficiently carried out as a continuous optimization problem, hence enjoys gradient-based computation. The theory establishes the connection of this model to a random partition distribution under multiple views. Compared to single-view clustering approaches, substantially more interpretable results are obtained when clustering brains from a human traumatic brain injury study, using high-dimensional gene expression data.

From this information, we can obtain the causal order among the observed variables. The next question is whether the causal effects can be uniquely identified as well. We show that causal effects among observed variables cannot be identified uniquely under mere assumptions of faithfulness and non-Gaussianity of exogenous noises.

We show that the procedure is optimal in the sense that it achieves the optimal convergence rate that is achievable by a biclustering oracle, adaptively over the whole class, up to constants. This is further formalized by deriving a minimax lower bound over a class of biclustering problems.  The optimal rate we obtain sharpens some of the existing results and generalizes others to a wide regime of  average degree growth, from sparse networks with average degrees growing arbitrarily slowly  to fairly dense networks with average degrees of order $\\sqrt{n}$.

Models for $Y$ that use all of its causal covariates as predictors enjoy the property of being invariant across different environments or interventional settings. Given data from such environments, this property has been exploited for causal discovery. Here, we extend this inference principle to situations in which some (discrete-valued) direct causes of $ Y $ are unobserved. Such cases naturally give rise to switching regression models. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence, consistency and asymptotic normality of the MLE in linear switching regression models with Gaussian noise, and construct a test for the equality of such models.
