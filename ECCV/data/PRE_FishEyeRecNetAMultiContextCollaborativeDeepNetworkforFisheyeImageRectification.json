Unlike existing methods that mainly focus on extracting hand-crafted features from the input distorted images, which have limited expressive power and are often unreliable, our method learns both high-level semantic and low- level appearance information for distortion parameter estimation. Our network consists of three collaborative sub-networks and is end-to-end trainable. A dis- tortion rectification layer is designed to perform rectification on both the input fisheye image and corresponding scene parsing results. For training, we construct a synthesized dataset covering a wide range of scenes and distortion parameters. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms state of the art models on the synthesized and real fisheye images, both qualitatively and quantitatively.  In our further work, we will extend this framework to handle other distortion correction tasks like the general radial lens distortion correction. Also, we will explore to handle unseen semantic classes for rectification.  6 Acknowledgment  This work is partially supported by Australian Research Council Projects (FL- 170100117, DP-180103424 and LP-150100671), National Natural Science Foun- dation of China (Grant No. 61405252) and State Scholarship Fund of China (Grant No. 201503170310). .
