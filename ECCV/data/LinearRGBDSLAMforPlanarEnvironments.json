{"1": "We propose a new formulation for including orthogonal planar features as a global model into a linear SLAM approach based on sequential Bayesian filtering. Previous planar SLAM algorithms estimate the camera poses and multiple landmark planes in a pose graph optimization. However, since it is formulated as a high dimensional nonlinear optimization problem, there is no guarantee the algorithm will converge to the global optimum. To overcome these limitations, we present a new SLAM method that jointly estimates camera position and planar landmarks in the map within a linear Kalman filter framework. It is rotations that make the SLAM problem highly nonlinear. Therefore, we solve for the rotational motion of the camera using structural regularities in the Manhattan world (MW), resulting in a linear SLAM formulation. We test our algorithm on standard RGB-D benchmarks as well as additional large indoor environments, demonstrating comparable performance to other state-of-the-art SLAM methods without the use of expensive nonlinear optimization."}
