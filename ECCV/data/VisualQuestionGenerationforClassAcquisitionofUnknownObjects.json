{"1": "Traditional image recognition methods only consider objects belonging to already learned classes. However, since training a recognition model with every object class in the world is unfeasible, a way of getting information on unknown objects (i.e., objects whose class has not been learned) is necessary. A way for an image recognition system to learn new classes could be asking a human about objects that are unknown. In this paper, we propose a method for generating questions about unknown objects in an image, as means to get information about classes that have not been learned. Our method consists of a module for proposing objects, a module for identifying unknown objects, and a module for generating questions about unknown objects. The experimental results via human evaluation show that our method can successfully get information about unknown objects in an image dataset.
