Yu et al.  channel. In Fig. 3, we show some randomly selected images from three di\ufb00erent datasets and their corresponding visualizations.  The visualizations all suggest that the proposed model is capable of ignor- ing cluttered backgrounds and tends to activate strongly on highly specific se- mantic parts. The highlighted activation regions in project5 1, project5 2 and project5 3 are strongly related to semantic parts, such as heads, wings and breast in CUB; front bumpers, wheels and lights in Cars; cockpit, tail stabilizers and engine in Aircraft. These parts are crucial to distinguish the category. More- over, our model is highly consistent with the human perception that resolve the fine details when perceive scenes or objects. In Fig. 3, we can see that the con- volution layers (relu5 1, relu5 2, relu5 3) provide a rough localization of target object. Based on this, the projection layers (project5 1, project5 2, project5 3) further determine essential parts of the object, which distinguish its category by successive interaction and integration of di\ufb00erent part features. The process is consistent with the coarse-to-fine nature of human perception [20] inspired by the Gestalt dictum that the \u201cwhole\u201d is prior to the \u201cparts\u201d and it also provides an intuitive explanation as to why our framework can model subtle and local di\ufb00erences between subcategories without explicit part detection.  5 Conclusions  In this paper, we propose a hierarchical bilinear pooling approach to fuse multi- layer features for fine-grained recognition, which combines inter-layer interac- tions and discriminative feature learning in a mutually-reinforced way. The pro- posed network requires no bounding box/part annotations and can be trained end-to-end. Extensive experiments on birds, cars and aircrafts demonstrate the e\ufb00ectiveness of our framework. In the future, we will conduct extended research on two directions, i.e., how to e\ufb00ectively fuse more layer features to obtain part representation at multiple scales, and how to merge e\ufb00ective methods for parts localization to learn better fine-grained representation.
