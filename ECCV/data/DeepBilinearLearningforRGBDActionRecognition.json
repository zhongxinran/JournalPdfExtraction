{"1": "In this paper, we focus on exploring modality-temporal mutual information for RGB-D action recognition. In order to learn time-varying information and multi-modal features jointly, we propose a novel deep bilinear learning framework. In the framework, we propose bilinear blocks that consist of two linear pooling layers for pooling the input cube features from both modality and temporal directions, separately. To capture rich modality-temporal information and facilitate our deep bilinear learning, a new action feature called modality-temporal cube is presented in a tensor structure for characterizing RGB-D actions from a comprehensive perspective. Our method is extensively tested on two public datasets with four different evaluation settings, and the results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches."}
