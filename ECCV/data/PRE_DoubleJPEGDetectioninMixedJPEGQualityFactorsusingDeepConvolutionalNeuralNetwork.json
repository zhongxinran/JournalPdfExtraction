(a) is a manipulated image by changing the color of a bird, (b) is the ground truth and, (c) - (e) are the detection results for images generated according to each quality factor.  it was impossible to detect the operation area. Because the DCT coe\ufb03cients of a single JPEG block and a double JPEG block were almost identical, the network could not distinguish between the two classes. Fig. 7 shows the detection results according to changing the second quality factor (standard quality factor). Although it was impossible to detect image manipulation with the same quality factor, as the quality factor di\ufb00erence increased, the proposed network could detect the manipulation region.  6 Conclusion  Current double JPEG detection methods only work in very limited situations and cannot be applied to real situations. To overcome this limits, we have cre- ated a new dataset using JPEG quantization tables from actual forensic images and designed a novel deep CNN for double JPEG detection using statistical his- togram features from each block with a vectorized quantization table. We have also proven that the proposed network can detect various manipulations with mixed JPEG quality factors.
