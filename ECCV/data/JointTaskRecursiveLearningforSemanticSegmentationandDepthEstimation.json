{"1": "In this paper, we propose a novel joint Task-Recursive Learning (TRL) framework for the closing-loop semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation tasks. TRL can recursively refine the results of both tasks through serialized task-level interactions. In order to mutually-boost for each other, we encapsulate the interaction into a specific Task-Attentional Module (TAM) to adaptively enhance some counterpart patterns of both tasks. Further, to make the inference more credible, we propagate previous learning experiences on both tasks into the next network evolution by explicitly concatenating previous responses. The sequence of task-level interactions are finally evolved along a coarse-to-fine scale space such that the required details may be reconstructed progressively. Extensive experiments on NYU-Depth v2 and SUN RGB-D datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results for monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation."}
