{"1": "Hyperspectral image (HSI) recovery from a single RGB image has attracted much   attention, whose performance has recently been shown to be sensitive to the   camera spectral sensitivity (CSS). In this paper, we present an efficient   convolutional neural network (CNN) based method, which can jointly select the   optimal CSS from a candidate dataset and learn a mapping to recover HSI from a   single RGB image captured with this algorithmically selected camera. Given a   specific CSS, we first present a HSI recovery network, which accounts for the   underlying characteristics of the HSI, including spectral nonlinear mapping and spatial similarity. Later, we append a CSS selection layer onto the recovery network, and the optimal CSS can thus be automatically determined from the network weights under the nonnegative sparse constraint. Experimental results show that our HSI recovery network outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and perceptive quality, and the selection layer always returns a CSS consistent to the best one determined by exhaustive search."}
