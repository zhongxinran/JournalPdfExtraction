{"1": "Point clouds obtained from 3D scans are typically sparse, irregular, and noisy, and required to be consolidated. In this paper, we present the first deep learning based {em edge-aware} technique to facilitate the consolidation of point clouds. We design our network to process points grouped in local patches, and train it to learn and help consolidate points, deliberately for edges. To achieve this, we formulate a regression component to simultaneously recover 3D point coordinates and point-to-edge distances from upsampled features, and an edge-aware joint loss function to directly minimize distances from output points to 3D meshes and to edges. Compared with previous neural network based works, our consolidation is {em edge-aware/}. During the synthesis, our network can attend to the detected sharp edges and enable more accurate 3D reconstructions. Also, we trained our network on virtual scanned point clouds, demonstrated the performance of our method on both synthetic and real point clouds, presented various surface reconstruction results, and showed how our method outperforms the state-of-the-arts."}
