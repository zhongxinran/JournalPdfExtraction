{"1": "This paper proposes an original problem of emph{stereo computation from a single (additive) mixture image}-- a challenging problem that had not been researched before.  The goal is to separate (ie unmix) a single mixture image into two constitute image layers, such that the two layers form a left-right stereo image pair, from which a valid disparity map can be recovered. This is a severely illposed problem,  from one input image one effectively aims to recover three (ie, left image, right image and a disparity map).  In this work we give a novel deep-learning based solution, by jointly solving the two subtasks of image layer separation as well as stereo matching.  Training our deep net is a simple task, as it does not need to have disparity maps.  Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method."}
