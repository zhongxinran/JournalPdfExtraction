{"1": "Person re-identification (re-ID) poses unique challenges for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) in that classes in the source and target sets (domains) are entirely different and that image variations are largely caused by cameras. Given a labeled source training set and an unlabeled target training set, we aim to improve the generalization ability of re-ID models on the target testing set. To this end, we introduce a Hetero-Homogeneous Learning (HHL) method. Our method enforces two properties simultaneously: 1) camera invariance, learned via positive pairs formed by unlabeled target images and their camera style transferred counterparts; 2) domain connectedness, by regarding source / target images as negative matching pairs to the target / source images. The first property is implemented by homogeneous learning because training pairs are collected from the same domain. The second property is achieved by heterogeneous learning because we sample training pairs from both the source and target domains. On Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and CUHK03, we show that the two properties contribute indispensably and that very competitive re-ID UDA accuracy is achieved.
