{"1": "A novel algorithm to segment out objects in a video sequence is proposed in this work. First, we extract object instances in each frame. Then, we select a visually important object instance in each frame to construct the salient object track through the sequence. This can be formulated as finding the maximal weight clique in a complete k-partite graph, which is NP hard. Therefore, we develop the sequential clique optimization (SCO) technique to efficiently determine the cliques corresponding to salient object tracks. We convert these tracks into video object segmentation results. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art video object segmentation and video salient object detection algorithms on recent benchmark datasets."}
