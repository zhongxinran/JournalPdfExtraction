It contains 50025 images of shoes with annotations on 4000 ordered pairs for each of 10 fine-grained attributes. The method in [2] does not directly work on this dataset because of its \u201cordered sequence\u201d requirement on the input data.

To exploit the underlying relationships between latent representations of a variety of attributes among a collection of images in a dataset, we proposed a simple framework based on natural instantiation of graph neural network. This formulation of a graph neural network can e\ufb00ectively encode the correlational information among multiple images and the multiple attributes as demonstrated in our experiments on three di\ufb00erent datasets. Our framework can be used to learn the relative attributes either one at a time or all at once with only a modest increase in the number of parameters compared to other multi-task based methods. Because our framework learns mainly from pairs of images and does not require a full ranking it concurrently is less stringent on the annotation requirements of the training dataset. To the best of our knowl- edge, this proposal is among the first to explore the e\ufb03cacy of multi-task GNN formulations for relative attribute learning. Our experiments also demonstrate the e\ufb00ectiveness of this architecture in achieving or surpassing the state-of-the- art results even for binary attributes prediction, where each attribute is predicted in a binary classification setup. The project webpage includes results on other applications, including predicting body mass index (BMI) that were not covered in detail in the main paper.  6 Acknowledgment  This work was partially supported by funding from American Family Insurance and UW CPCP AI117924.
