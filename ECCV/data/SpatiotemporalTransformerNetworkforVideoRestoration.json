{"1": "State-of-the-art video restoration methods integrate optical flow estimation networks to utilize temporal information. However, these networks typically consider only a pair of consecutive frames and hence are not capable of capturing long-range temporal dependencies and fall short of establishing correspondences across several timesteps. To alleviate these problems, we propose a novel Spatio-temporal Transformer Network (STTN) which handles multiple frames at once and thereby manages to mitigate the common nuisance of occlusions in optical flow estimation. Our proposed STTN comprises a module that estimates optical flow in both space and time and a resampling layer that selectively warps target frames using the estimated flow. In our experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed network and show state-of-the-art restoration results in video super-resolution and video deblurring."}
