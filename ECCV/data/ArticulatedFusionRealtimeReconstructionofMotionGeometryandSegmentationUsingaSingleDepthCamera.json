{"1": "This paper proposes a real-time dynamic scene reconstruction method capable of reproducing the motion, geometry, and segmentation simultaneously given live depth stream from a single RGB-D camera. Our approach fuses geometry frame by frame and uses a segmentation-enhanced node graph structure to drive the deformation of geometry in registration step. A two-level node motion optimization is proposed. The optimization space of node motions and the range of physically-plausible deformations are largely reduced by taking advantage of the articulated motion prior, which is solved by an efficient node graph segmentation method. Compared to previous fusion-based dynamic scene reconstruction methods, our experiments show robust and improved reconstruction results for tangential and occluded motions."}
