{"1": "Photos taken in hazy weather are usually covered with white masks and often lose important details. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for single image dehazing by learning dark channel and transmission priors. First, we build an energy model for dehazing using dark channel and transmission priors and design an iterative optimization algorithm using proximal operators for these two priors. Second, we unfold the iterative algorithm to be a deep network, dubbed as \textit{proximal dehaze-net}, by learning the proximal operators using convolutional neural networks. Our network combines the advantages of  traditional prior-based dehazing methods and deep learning methods by incorporating haze-related prior learning into deep network. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art  performance for single image dehazing."}
