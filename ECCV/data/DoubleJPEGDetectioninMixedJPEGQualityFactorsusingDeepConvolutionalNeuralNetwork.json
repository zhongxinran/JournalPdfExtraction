{"1": "Double JPEG detection is essential for detecting various image manipulations. This paper proposes a novel deep convolutional neural network for double JPEG detection using statistical histogram features from each block with a vectorized quantization table. In contrast to previous methods, the proposed approach handles mixed JPEG quality factors and is suitable for real-world situations. We collected real-world JPEG images from the image forensic service and generated a new double JPEG dataset with 1120 quantization tables to train the network. The proposed approach was verified experimentally to produce a state-of-the-art performance, successfully detecting various image manipulations."}
